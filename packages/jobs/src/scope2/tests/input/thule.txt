GHG emissions

We follow the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to disclose our scope 1, 2, and emissions. We do not account for Category 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15 as they are not within our operational control or not applicable. In 2023, Thule Group conducted a baseline recalculation of our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as SBTi recommends a recalculation every 5 years.

While we did not undergo any structural changes in 2023, the primary changes in the emissions calculation were in methodology due to increased knowledge about purchased materials and emission factors. The updated calculations showed a difference of 3.3 percent in scope 3 emissions in 2019, which is under the SBTi threshold of 5 percent, so we do not need to reformulate existing short-term SBTi targets.

Thule has made two acquisitions in 2024.   However, emissions from those acquisitions are excluded in the 2024 inventory. In 2025, we plan to map the total emissions from those two entities, when we publish the 2025 Annual Report.

Targets

CLIMATE GOALS FOR THE 2030 AGENDA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SBTI:

- An absolute reduction of 46.2 percent in scope 1 emissions until 2030 compared to the 2019 base year.
- Continue the active sourcing of 100 percent renewable electricity at our facilities and offices with more than 12 employees until 2030.
- Reduce absolute emissions related to purchased materials, upstream and downstream transportation (scope 3) with 28 percent by 2030 compared to the 2019 base year.

OUR IMPACTS AND ACTIONS TAKEN IN 2024

We comprehensively track, measure and document emissions (air, water, soil and noise emissions from facilities and transport) and waste streams, and our production sites are ISO 14001 certified.

with the CSRD and Regulation (EC) No 166/2006. Our baseline assessment confirmed minimal pollutant emissions, primarily from truck emissions, biogas heating, prototype productions in R&amp;D (notably zinc), and PVC-fabric welding for awnings. However, based on our site pollution screening in 2024, as well as the supplier data we assessed from a selection of our tier 1 suppliers, the emissions are below the threshold, according to the Regulation (EC) No 166/ 2006, thereby making the impacts below the threshold.

In 2024, we conducted a site pollution screening for emissions to air to establish a reporting baseline

We will continue to review the impacts and risks in 2025, so that we can consider new information when determining materiality in 2025.

For our 2024 reporting, the material topics are Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs), and Substances of Concern (SoCs).

NET-ZERO 2050 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SBTi:

- Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets: 90 percent absolute reduction (compared with base year 2019) and 10 percent carbon offset.
- Reduce C0 2 eq emissions from product materials for all new products having more than second year revenue &gt;20MSEK, compared to a benchmark product until 2030.
- Maintain a recycling rate of at least 98 percent, including hazardous waste.

*The data for 2022 and 2023 energy consumption from fossil sources, have been revised to correct the emission of fuel from company cars. As a result, the total non-renewable fuel consumption in 2022, of 10,500 MWh and 10,900 MWh in 2023 have been amended (refer to Thule Group 2023 Annual Report). Additionally, the reported values for purchased or acquired electricity, heating, steam, and cooling from renewable sources have been corrected due to calculation errors in purchased electricity, resulting in an adjustment of electricity consumption from 19,400 MWh in 2022 to 18 976, and total renewable purchased electricity of 15, 900 MWh in 2023 has been amended to 13,647 MWh. The total purchased renewable electricity is at 100%, so it is consistent with our Scope 2 target. However, the share of total energy consumption from renewable sources, according to the ESRS disclosure requirements, is calculated together with the energy consumption also used for energy production, as well as other fuels used for heating, vehicles etc. Therefore, that share of renewable energy is not exclusive to electricity consumption.

POOR CLIMATE ACTION SCENARIO; 3 DEGREES AND HIGHER

In (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) CO 2 and methane emissions continue to rise, fossil fuels are still in use even if there are significant declines in emission growth rates over the second half of the century. However, there are also improvements reduction on aerosols, as well as on energy efficient technologies.

Atmospheric CO 2 levels rise from current-day levels of 400 up to 936 ppm by the end of this century. CO 2 -equivalent levels (including emissions of other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, aerosols, and other substances that affect climate) reach more than 1,200 ppm by 2100, and crossing the 2°C global warming level in the midterm and long term period, is very likely to occur under the very high GHG emissions scenario, and likely to occur under the high GHG emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0)

In a poor mitigation scenario, the world continues to prioritize short-term economic growth, driven by the continued use of fossil fuels and energy intensive activities and lifestyles.

Most economic and social efforts are in protecting people and businesses from climate change impacts, and climate adaptation measures become a heavy burden on organizations and the economy.

Under this scenario, the main risks for Thule are from physical climate impacts, which entails risks to productivity and physical assets, risks to supply chain, and physical environment which can prevent people from enjoying the natural environment, as well as risks from increased technological or energy efficient costs.

INTERMEDIATE ACTION; 2 DEGREES

Global warming of 2°C would extremely likely be exceeded in the intermediate GHG emissions scenario. (SSP 2-4.5). While some economies use the prolongation of warmer periods, and shortening of colder periods as advantageous, it can be extreme heat and cold to others part of the world. Heat waves, rain and drought can be more intensified, and other physical impacts can get higher. The risk of impacts to the value chain is higher in this scenario.

Progress toward sustainability is slow, with disparate development and income growth. Business continues as usual, with slow progress in sustainability. There is a heavier cost to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as in disaster risk management.

Metrics and targets
Actions and resources

We are actively working to achieve our emission reduction targets. Our production site decarbonization plans align with our Group's Strategic plans until 2030, and will help us achieve the SBTi scope 1 target by 2030. In 2024, one of the key actions towards, emission reduction and climate change mitigation involved installing heat pumps in Pila, Poland, as part of our decarbonization strategy. We also aim to transition to a 100 percent electric or fossil-free vehicle fleet by 2025.

ACCURACY

The carbon footprint is deemed to have achieved sufficient accuracy. The emission factors have been chosen with a conservative approach.

FUTURE FOCUS

-   All new development projects that meet certain financial thresholds in the second year of sales, to reduce their CO 2 eq emissions by a minimum of 30 percent compared to a defined benchmark product.
-   Use of eco-design models, material emissions database and collection of previous life cycle assessments to improve product climate impact.
-   Circular thinking through extended product lifetimes and modular focus in product families, which simplifies recycling and expands the offering of spare parts.
-   Increase the share of recycled materials or materials with lower greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the product's safety or lifespan.

Greenhouse gases

We aim to reduce our environmental impact by reducing our emissions of direct and indirect greenhouse gases.

Committed employees drive the development of Net-Zero
FOCUS AREAS

We are driven by the highest standards of safety, function, and respect for the environment. We are curious and passionate entrepreneurs who believe that people have the power to move the world forward. At each product launch, we aim to reveal a glimpse of the future in each product category and always lower the climate footprint.

Emission reduction aligned with the 2030 SBTi and Net-Zero target for 2050.

- Continue sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our plants and offices (scope 2).
- New products, with at least SEK 20 million in sales in their second year, must cut CO 2 eq emissions by at least 30 percent compared to a previous version.

Products

We also set targets for reducing product emissions. New products that meet certain financial thresholds must reduce emissions by at least 30 percent compared to a benchmark product, thereby integrating emission reduction strategies into R&amp;D. In 2024, we significantly reduced emissions in our new Thule EasyFold 3 compared to the previous product. Thule EasyFold 3 reduced emissions by 50 percent compared to the previous generation, due to the reduced weight of aluminum, using lower-emission aluminum and recycled plastic. We also designed for durability and reparability to extend the product's life.

Metrics and targets
Targets

Our current targets related to circular economy and product sustainability include:

- All new development projects which are expected to reach above a certain financial threshold in the second year of sale, shall reduce their CO 2 eq emissions by a minimum of 30 percent compared to a defined benchmark product.
- All new development projects which are expected to reach above a certain financial threshold in the second year of sale, must evaluate their ecodesign performance in accordance with internal routines and processes.

BACKGROUND AND CRITERIA
METHODOLOGY

The assurance provider South Pole was engaged by Thule Group AB ('Thule') to provide independent assurance of Thule Group's GHG reporting for the calendar year 2024. The GHG inventory has been developed by Thule based on GRI and Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards. The scope of this assurance covers and is limited to GHG accounting and reporting.

The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition, 2004), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable organization Development and the World Resources Institute, have been used as criteria for reviewing Thule Group's GHG inventory. This assurance is aligned with AA1000AS v3 with Type 2 moderate-level assurance. This assurance statement has the same level of assurance as previous years from South Pole but excludes the label from AccountAbility.

About the Sustainability Report

INTENDED USER

The intended users of this assurance statement are, among others, the management, and stakeholders of Thule Group.

The greenhouse gas accounting was performed by Thule through a platform provided by a separate third-party organization. The scope of the assurance made by South Pole is the independent and objective review of these reported GHG emissions. A review of the submitted documentation was undertaken, and other available documents were checked by the members of the verifi cation team. All data input entered into the platform were assumed correct by the South Pole team due to no visibility of raw data.

In addition to reviewing the processes by which Thule Group defines the sustainability issues relevant to and material for its operations and stakeholders, the verifi cation process checked the following for the GHG emissions:

-   definition of system boundaries and completeness of climate impact accounting;
- relevance of input data;
- accuracy of emission factors;
-   accuracy of climate impact calculations of owned sources, purchased electricity and heat, and other indirect sources; and
- accuracy and reliability of assumptions.

ADHERENCE TO GHG PROTOCOL PRINCIPLES

Based on the scope and methods of the review, we can conclude that Thule Group calculated its carbon footprint in 2024 in accordance with the principles of the GHG Protocol.

CONCLUSIONS

Based on the boundaries of the review and the methods used, South Pole comes to the following conclusions:

1.   Thule Group has calculated and reported its 2024 carbon footprint following the principles covered by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
2.   Thule Group has implemented processes and procedures that follow the guidelines of the GHG Protocol and aligns with the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard.
3.   Based on the completed review, no issues or circumstances emerged that gave us any reason to deem that Thule Group's 2024 GHG reporting did not meet the current standard's requirements and criteria.

All relevant emission sources within the chosen system boundary were accounted for. Where estimates were deemed necessary to measure GHG emissions, Thule Group provided satisfactory comments on the mode of estimation. The emission factors, units and calculation formulas were correct.

In terms of the reliability of performance data, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data and claims had not been properly collected from the information reported at an operational level, nor that the assumptions used were inappropriate. Thule Group has a process whereby data is collected from each site, including processed reports provided by the third-party service providers for logistics and consolidated at the Group level. The choice of assumptions and emission factors followed a conservative approach. Emission factors were derived from credible sources and were found to be applied correctly. A few updates have been carried out by Thule Group based on findings by the verification team.

Thule Group in brief    2024 in brief    CEO's statement

CEO'S STATEMENT

RELEVANCE AND COMPLETENESS

Thule Group's carbon footprint reflects the company's GHG emissions well, and all material GHG emission sources are accounted for within the boundary, especially with the inclusion of purchased goods and services. Exclusions have been disclosed and justified.

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)

In 2024, Thule Group requested 178 suppliers (representing 90 percent of purchased spend in 2024) to disclose their emissions data and environmental impact via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). These efforts are geared toward reducing emissions and enhancing social responsibility throughout our value chain.

Life cycle analysis - a comparison

When developing new products, current or similar versions are assessed to see how the product materials contribute with CO 2 eq emissions. By   analyzing the input materials, we identify high emission contributors and can take active decisions regarding material type and geographical origin of the resources. We also investigate how recycled options or materials produced with renewable electricity could reduce the climate impact of the new product.

Climate Scenario analysis

We use the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to identify climate risks, which we categorize according to physical risks, and transitional risks.

Our analysis combines the three following scenarios, that draw on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP's) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change in 2021.

- 1 Very low and low GHG emissions and CO 2 emissions declining to net-zero around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2 emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), which aligns with the Paris Agreement.
- 2 Intermediate GHG emissions (SSP2-4.5) and CO 2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century, are referred to as Intermediate Climate Action.
- 3 High and very high GHG emissions (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), and CO 2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, are referred to as Poor Climate Action.

Physical risks include acute (coastal flood hazard, drought hazard, extra-tropical cyclone hazard, flood hazard, landslide hazard, severe storm hazard, tropical storm and cyclone hazard and wildfire hazard) and chronic risks (climate change exposure, cooling degree days, heating degrees days, heat stress, sea level rise, water stress). Transitional risks include policy, market, technological and reputational risks from climate change impacts.

The climate scenario analysis helps us to ensure that our business strategies are resilient to climate change impacts in a range of possible future scenarios.

We have conducted a qualitative analysis to understand how climate impacts create risks and opportunities for Thule Group in the short term (2-5 years) medium term (5-10 years) and long term (10-15) years. The time frame is aligned with our key strategic plans, and external climate commitments.

PARIS AGREEMENT SCENARIO; 1.5 DEGREES (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and requires significant reductions of global emissions, including net-zero targets for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions before the end of the century.

In this scenario, an active awareness of the urgency of decarbonization, drives collaborative actions across governments and companies to reduce emissions to Net-Zero by 2050. This will put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. However, while emissions growth is decoupled from economic growth, the effects of 'locked-in' climate change impacts continue to impose costs. The sustained success of businesses depends on how effective their transition is to a low carbon economy.

Thule's global targets are aligned with the SBTi 1.5 degrees target for 2030, and we are also committed to Net-Zero by 2050. The main risks and opportunities in this scenario for Thule are related to transitional impacts such as compliance with emerging policies and trends, transitioning to low emission technologies, decarbonization of sites, investing in climate resilient assets and properties. There are also market risks and opportunities associated with the price and availability of purchased goods and materials, and consequently in the products we offer. We will also have to adapt to the transitions in the external world in terms of transitions to energy, infrastructure, transport systems, and industrial systems.

Metrics and targets
Value Chain Engagement of Suppliers

Information on selected material topics with reporting boundary of Thule tier-1 impact, risk and opportunities.

In 2024, our supplier engagement approach was motivated by the following aims:

- 1 Get insight into our suppliers' sustainability management, governance and ambitions (maturity).
- 2 Identify Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IRO) hotspots in Thule's supplier base in tier 1.
- 3 Inform the suppliers about upcoming reporting requirements and building partnerships in reporting.

Supplier selection was based on the following criteria:

Summary of policies, actions and targets identified in the value chain
Climate Change and Energy

Supplier engagement on Climate Change and Energy Use shows that the majority of suppliers have medium to high risks, impacts and opportunities.

Due to restricting the impact assessment to supplier's own operations, the biggest impacts were identified for the companies which operate own energy-intensive production facilities.

Suppliers are actively working on reducing their carbon footprint through various initiatives. Most suppliers have a policy, or similar corporate document to manage impacts, risks and opportunities regarding energy use and climate change. Many are calculating their emissions according to established protocols and setting Science-Based Targets. Many suppliers identified scope 3 as an area of improvement, both for setting reduction targets and improving data quality and coverage.

Efforts include improving energy efficiency, using green electricity, and setting ambitious goals such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. However, some suppliers face challenges due to energy-intensive processes and limited access to renewable energy sources. Overall, there is a strong commitment to reducing emissions and improving data quality related emissions. Several of the interviewed suppliers mentioned their ISO certifications or ambitions to get certified (14001, 45001, 5001, 9001), which influences their commitment and efforts for different sustainability topics positively.

EXAMPLE OF MATERIAL MATTERS Our impact on the environment

Reduced emissions from our products and from our own operations.

UPGRADED VERSION CUT EMISSIONS IN HALF

As example, this methodology was applied during the development of Thule EasyFold Gen 3 where Thule EasyFold XT served as benchmark. By reducing the usage of aluminum, using aluminum produced with hydro power and recycled plastics where possible, a 50 percent emission reduction from the product materials could be achieved.

Climate Change
CLIMATE ACTION - AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR VALUE CHAIN
SUSTAINABILITY POLICY

We produce long-lasting, high-quality, and safe products so that people can enjoy the outdoors. Caring about the environment is in our DNA, and it is in our business interest to minimize negative impacts on people and the environment as much as possible.

STRATEGY
Our decarbonization strategy

Our work throughout our value chain is characterized by high ambitions. The climate targets for 2030 are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and they are verified according to the science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi, along with our Net-Zero targets for 2050.

We are systematically moving towards fossil-free operations by adopting ambitious targets that are clear to everyone.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Without affecting our assurance opinion, we would also provide the following recommendations:

-   Consider if the scope of calculated emissions can be revisited. Only operational waste is included, which is category 12 of the GHG Protocol, but the category End of life treatment of sold products is excluded. Since Thule is a manufacturing and product selling company the treatment of the final product will also have a climate impact.
-   For 2025 calculations, please include activities and emissions from acquisitions.
