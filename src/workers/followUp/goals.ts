Extract the company goals for reducing their carbon emissions.
Be as accurate as possible when extracting goals. These values will be plotted in a graph later on.


Prioritize the list and only include the most important goals. If the list is long, only include max three most important ones (prioritize climate goals).

If no year is mentioned, set year to null.
