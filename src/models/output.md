###### AstraZeneca sustainability resources

###### What science can do

####### Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic (CVRM) diseases

CVRM diseases are complex and interconnected.
It's by understanding their interconnections and targeting the mechanisms that drive them that we'll be able to detect diagnose and treat people earlier and more effectively.
Stop disease progression and ultimately improve and save the lives of the millions of patients living with these diseases.

###### Assurance

Bureau Veritas has provided limited assurance for sustainability activities reported in the sustainability data annex and in the Annual Report 2023.
Details are described in the Letters of Assurance which are publicly available.
Assurance is in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ (‘ISAE 3410’) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.

### Chief Executive Officer’s statement

We must recognise the strong correlation between healthy people and a healthy planet the science is clear.
The number of heat related deaths could more than triple by 2050 without significant action and we're witnessing a steep rise in heart and metabolic conditions cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to environmental factors.
The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate health crisis in 2023.

With the healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions we must significantly reduce our environmental footprint.
At AstraZeneca we're driving deep decarbonisation across our value chain through our flagship Ambition Zero Carbon strategy.
We're investing $1 billion to reduce emissions from the lab to the patient and are integrating more circular approaches into the discovery development and delivery of medicines with the latest digital technologies and innovation.

We're also restoring nature and supporting biodiversity through our AZ Forest programme which expanded in 2023 to a $400 million initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030.
Learning from scientific and ecological experts and local communities is central to our approach with 19.9 million trees planted to date.

Improving health system sustainability is also central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa programme.
In collaboration with nine African governments and partners we're working to prevent and control hypertension and decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease.
Over nine million people with elevated blood pressure have been identified to date helping reduce the pressure on health services.

At AstraZeneca we're guided by our Values and commitment to ethics and transparency.
We champion a culture of inclusion and belonging recognising the power of diversity in driving innovation around the globe.
In our latest employee survey 87 per cent said they understand how they can contribute to AstraZeneca's sustainability priorities which fills me with both pride and hope.

When we come together we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient equitable and net zero.

Healthcare is our common foundation.
It's the bedrock of society and when we're healthy communities thrive and economies prosper.
Yet with ageing populations the rising burden of chronic disease and the growing impact of the climate crisis on health health systems are struggling to meet people's health needs.
And around the world inequities in healthcare are growing from low to high income countries with vulnerable populations the most affected.

We embed this collaboration mindset across all of our sustainability efforts recognising that when we come together we can transform the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient equitable and net zero.
We want people to live their healthiest lives wherever they live.
The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health Systems Task Force is a public private partnership we're proud to convene which focuses on accelerating the transition to net zero health systems.
In 2023 we launched joint environmental targets for suppliers saw the establishment of a China Health Working Group and recently concluded a multi-party agreement In 2024 we remain focused on our commitment to delivering positive impact for the health of people society and our planet.
A sustainable future starts with health.

to access renewable power in China.

The Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience is a further example of our commitment.
Together with partners we're delivering evidence based recommendations which are leading to policy reforms to strengthen health systems.
For example in Italy clinical pathways for chronic diseases are being reviewed to identify the investments needed in Japan a digital medical information platform is being prioritised and in Brazil the improvement of community based prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus.
These are three of the 40 countries in which our Young Health Programme is active.
Here we're empowering young people to make healthier choices and have directly engaged over 15 million young people on non communicable disease risk factors since 2010.

#### 2023 recognition

As a global business we have a responsibility to lead.
We are committed to using our capabilities to help tackle some of society's greatest challenges.

###### Integration with our strategy and business model

We are working to identify barriers to access and are innovating to deliver our life changing medicines in a sustainable and equitable way through global regional and local partnerships.
We incentivise select senior executives and in country managers to perform on access initiatives with financial and non‑ financial rewards.
Our CEO also has access‑ related incentives linked to the company's ESG performance.

We publicly disclose outcomes of our access activities including progress on our commitments measurable goals objectives and targets for improving health equity for patients in the countries where we operate.

Central to this is our commitment to promoting prevention increasing access to diagnostics and treatments and strengthening health system sustainability and resilience.

We are focused on

- • Innovating to deliver life-changing medicines and future-proof global health systems

- • Partnering to improve health equity for patients now and in the long term

- • Transforming healthcare to secure a future where all people have equitable access to treatment

We collaborate on our Access to healthcare material focus areas on a cross functional basis to deliver our strategy and measure progress.

We also have a dedicated team within Global Corporate Affairs who oversee progress against targets and report on these to the Board Sustainability Committee along with the development of our health equity strategy and expansion of our access programmes.

Equitable access

##### Scope of this focus area

To drive equitable access to healthcare by embedding practices across the product portfolio including digital health clinical trial diversity patient centricity investing in rare diseases open innovation and intellectual property (IP) sharing arrangements.

We have therefore aligned our access initiatives to improve health equity by addressing local needs.
To do this we are

- • Creating integrated approaches including through collaboration with governments and utilising local expertise to identify and address shared priorities

- • Collaborating in cross-sector partnerships to improve health outcomes

###### Strategic approach

We are committed to improving equitable access to healthcare for patients globally including to our innovative product portfolio.
Our approach includes integrating programmes into local systems and delivering affordable medicines to patients.
We seek to drive positive We are playing our part to address health inequities and eliminate discrimination from the delivery of healthcare.
As a company at the forefront of scientific and medical innovation we are also harnessing the latest digital technologies to support improved access.
This includes using the power of data and analytics for early diagnosis and expanding access to the latest medical research and training for healthcare professionals.

We are committed to improving equitable access to healthcare for patients globally including to our innovative product portfolio.

##### Why it matters

Health should not be determined by who you are where you live or where you were born.
We are working to remove barriers to healthcare and give everyone the chance to be as healthy as possible.
Economic and supply barriers as well as geographic impediments inhibit universal access to high quality evidence based healthcare.
global health outcomes by

- • Addressing unmet medical need and barriers to access

- • Increasing the speed and breadth of patient access

- • Driving excellence in product life-cycle management

- • Understanding the long-term impacts of scientific advances

Additionally in developing countries there is an epidemiological shift from the prevalence of communicable to non communicable diseases (NCDs) however local healthcare provision varies in quality and the systems may not be in place to tackle this growing burden.
Programmes to control priority public health conditions also need to recognise the importance of the economic and social determinants of health.

##### Actions – key initiatives:

###### Diversity in clinical trials

We are committed to designing clinical programmes with equity at the forefront from idea inception to patient care.
Our approach is patient centric data driven and science led.
We are improving the diversity of clinical trial participants with strong data foundations tools and standards to align and track progress and external partnerships.
We work with industry groups regulatory agencies and local community groups to shape clinical trial diversity policies of the future while delivering for patients today.

####### Rare diseases

There are more than 10,000 known rare diseases and the vast majority (>90%) do not have an approved treatment.
This means that rare disease patients also face unique challenges in pursuing equitable access to healthcare such as significant delays in diagnosis greater chances of hospitalisation from preventable conditions scheduling and to diagnostic tools and supporting efforts to improve the experience of those participating in our clinical trials.
We also supply medicines for rare diseases through our patient support and expanded access programmes.

######## Intellectual property

AstraZeneca recognises our role in helping to make our products accessible and affordable to patients in need.
Our Commitment to Deliver Our Science to Patients details our efforts to address barriers our patients face financial or otherwise in developing and developed markets.
Those efforts include our approach to IP.
AstraZeneca seeks to protect innovations worldwide and we prioritise the countries where we seek patent protection.
AstraZeneca does not file patent applications in any low‑ income countries (LICs) or least developed countries (LDCs).
AstraZeneca also does not file in a number of low to middle income countries (LMICs) and medium human development countries (MHDCs).

travelling to appointments and accessing available treatments.

We believe people with rare diseases deserve the same attention and investment to find and access therapies as anyone else.
As we expand the geographies where our rare disease medicines are available we continue to build relationships with patient communities Reducing time to diagnosis and engaging policymakers are early in our development programmes to better understand their needs.
We focus on increasing clinical trial diversity developing improved data collection processes to enhance our understanding of how rare diseases affect specific patient populations improving access

Status Target met

Total community investment (not including patient assistance programmes).$115.4m

####### Strategic approach

AstraZeneca has adopted four key pricing principles that are designed among other things to support our affordability efforts globally

- • Sustainability: of both the healthcare system and our research-led business model

- • Value: reflects the clinical benefit of our medicines to patients and the broader impact on society, along with the positive economic impact to the healthcare system by reducing the need for additional medical intervention

####### Actions – key initiatives:

######## Patient access programmes

Our patient access programmes including patient assistance programmes use fully donated products without expectation of payment from the patient for any portion or to access the programme.
Our largest patient assistance programme is AZ&Me in the United States which provides eligible patients with AstraZeneca medicines free of charge.

Affordability and pricing

##### Scope of this focus area

To drive accessibility of medicines for diverse equitable and inclusive patient groups through company policy and programming including core pricing principles and access programmes.

###### Patient affordability programmes

Patient affordability programmes (PAPs) aim to close the gap in the ability to pay of patients who fund their own medicines and sometimes close a funding gap between capped government sponsored funding and the patient's ability to pay once funding from government ends.
We track PAPs in 25 countries most of which are LMICs where we adopt different programme types.
Examples include fixed PAP schemes tiered PAPs co‑pay support micro‑financing and bridging programmes.

##### Why it matters

| |
| |
| We are committed to addressing barriers to access and affordability. Our industry policymakers and payers need to work together to identify solutions. Through collaborations partnerships and stakeholder coalitions we are working to ensure essential and innovative medicines become more widely available. As a global business there are challenges that affect our flexibility to provide access to our medicines. These include pricing controls reimbursement mechanisms taxation and mark up systems plus a high frequency of regulatory changes. In addition supply chain complexity can increase costs and the economic downturn is adversely affecting ability to pay (where applicable). | [object Object]

###### Tiered pricing

We believe tiered pricing is a key enabler for broader and accelerated patient access in LMICs.
We do this by linking the cost of medicines with government and patient ability to pay based on macroeconomic indicators of local affordability (such as Gross National Income per capita national healthcare budgets and other relevant health economics considerations).

###### Value based agreements

Value based agreements across multiple therapy areas enable patient access while reducing uncertainty for payers (clinical or economic) by linking access reimbursement or price to real‑world clinical benefit or other While we are thoughtful in our pricing approach we understand the challenges that healthcare systems and patients face in terms of equity and affordability.
Recognising our shared responsibility we take a broad flexible approach to pricing to reflect the variation in healthcare systems.
We are committed to working in partnership with patients policymakers payers and the wider healthcare community to ensure access is as equitable widespread and as sustainable as possible.

Health system resilience

##### Scope of this focus area

To strengthen health systems by

- • Partnering with stakeholders in the development of research-based recommendations, advocating for health system policy reform and building capabilities to strengthen the delivery of health services.

- • Improving access to quality healthcare and providing solutions along a continuum of care

- from prevention, awareness, diagnosis and treatment to post-treatment and wellness.

- • Supporting the continuity of integrated and essential quality healthcare in communities affected by humanitarian emergencies through disaster relief.

##### Why it matters

The shifting burden of disease geopolitical fragmentation and the frequency of extreme weather events linked to the climate emergency all put pressure on health systems.
The COVID 19 pandemic tested health systems’ ability to respond to sudden shocks and crises while ensuring continuous access to healthcare services for patients.

Health system capacity remains under pressure at global regional and local levels with outbreaks of infectious diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza as well as the increasing prevalence of NCDs exacerbated by the growing impacts of climate change and ecosystem degradation on human health.
Health system resilience and capacity must be strengthened.

We are working towards a future where

- • Resilient health systems can respond and adapt effectively to crises while managing ongoing population health needs

- • Equitable health systems ensure everyone is able to live their healthiest life, by removing barriers to early disease detection, accurate diagnosis, access to clinical trials and high-quality therapies

- • Net-zero health systems improve patient outcomes and limit the environmental impact of care

###### Strategic approach

Sustainable healthcare for all requires investment in strengthening health systems with the infrastructure required to be responsive to population needs.
Our integrated approach puts health at the centre of a sustainable future by advocating for more strategic investment in health earlier action on disease and enhanced use of digital data and technology.

As shown by the COVID 19 pandemic where we learned what can be achieved when we collaborate at speed and at scale partnering with stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem is key to our shared success.
We are investing in ground breaking global collaborations company initiatives local partnerships and fast tracked innovation to give access to higher quality healthcare for more people worldwide.

####### Specific activities include:

- • Improving preparedness for future shocks and enhancing international coordination on scenario planning, response protocols and

reserve capacities • Optimising the location and focus of patient care through digital technologies • Addressing the social economic and ecological costs of disease through targeted prevention measures that are optimised to address risk factors and local challenges while leveraging our experience

in health programming • Improving the effectiveness of care for chronic diseases through defining implementing and monitoring improved

quality of care standards We aim to build the capabilities of health systems to best respond to patient needs by

- • Ensuring programming is locally and culturally relevant

- • Using our footprint to scale partnerships and collaborations

- • Establishing mechanisms for collaboration with our partners, for example through joint coordination, planning, follow-up and alignment on key performance indicators

- • Considering the long-term sustainability of our partnerships to effectively transfer

resources skills and capabilities and enable local ownership • Keeping the communities we serve at the heart of our partnerships by involving them in the design and delivery of programmes

The PHSSR is a non‑profit multi‑sector global collaboration established in 2020 by the London School of Economics the World Economic Forum and AstraZeneca with a unified goal to improve global health by building more sustainable and resilient health systems.
The partnership has since been joined by other members including Philips KPMG the Center for Asia‐Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI) and the WHO Foundation alongside additional organisations at regional and national levels.
It is now active in more than 30 countries worldwide.

With its unmatched collective expertise spanning health research policy and innovation the PHSSR has built and continues to expand upon one of the largest bodies of work on the sustainability and resilience of health systems globally.
Global experts work with national academics and policymakers to understand domestic challenges and develop tailored recommendations that can be actioned.
In 2023 PHSSR published its second summary report capturing research conducted in 18 countries a regional EU report featuring recommendations on tackling the growing burden of NCDs and several country‑specific reports.

The PHSSR is activating global leaders and partnering with national stakeholders to drive focused interventions and policy change.
In 2023 PHSSR has engaged with over 40 national and multilateral platforms and events including the World Health Assembly the World Health Summit and at the European Parliament.

####### Healthy Heart Africa

Our Healthy Heart Africa (HHA) programme is committed to reducing hypertension and the burden of cardiovascular disease aiming to reach 10 million people with elevated blood pressure across Africa by 2025. We work with local and global partners to raise cardiovascular awareness and offer training screening and reduced cost treatment where applicable.
By the end of 2023 the programme had conducted more than 47.9 million blood pressure screenings and trained more than 11,300 healthcare workers since launch in 2014. Also in 2023 the programme launched in eight of 10 new countries planned by 2024 working with implementing partners the African Christian Health Association Platform (ACHAP) and PATH in addition to the existing nine countries of operation.

####### Young Health Programme

Our Young Health Programme (YHP) aims to empower young people to make more informed choices about their health and catalyse a global youth led advocacy movement.
It is now active in 40 countries worldwide combining community programmes research advocacy and supporting the development of young leaders with a focus on vulnerable and under resourced communities.
Through partnerships with more than 60 non‑profit partners around the world including UNICEF the YHP has directly reached more than 15 million young people and trained more than 580,000 youth as Peer Educators since its launch in 2010.
In 2023 the YHP reached more than five million young people through prevention and education programmes.

Community investment Community investment at AstraZeneca is built upon the principles of equity transparency and partnership and working together to build healthy and resilient communities.
In 2023 we contributed $115.4 million in financial and non‑financial donations (including product donations) to more than 810 non‑profit partners across 76 countries.
We also donated $4.7 billion of medicines through patient assistance programmes around the world the largest of which is our AZ&Me Prescription Savings program in the US.

######## Our ambition

Accelerating the delivery of net zero healthcare proactively managing our environmental impact across all activities and investing in nature and biodiversity.

### Recognising the interconnection between a healthy planet and healthy people

Connection to health Supporting a healthy environment is critical to the health of people society and the planet.
We aim to improve health outcomes and help tackle the increasing prevalence of diseases linked to the impacts of climate change.
We are also investing in nature and biodiversity recognising the strong interconnection with population health.

Our material focus areas

- • Ambition Zero Carbon

- • Product sustainability

- • Natural resources

#### 2023 performance

67.6%

reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since 2015 a reduction of 420 kilotonnes CO2e >19.9m trees planted in Australia Brazil Ghana India Indonesia Rwanda the UK and the US since 2020 97.6% of paper based product packaging materials used supplied from sustainable sources achieving the 2023 target 750+ material suppliers with a critical role in patient supply screened to understand climate vulnerability in the upstream value chain

The conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and the protection and restoration of ecosystems are vital to shape a healthy future with resilient people and communities building harmony between society and the natural environment.

Beyond the benefits of our medicines to patients our contribution to society must respect our environment and ensure that our use of the planet's finite natural resources is sustainable.
We know that a healthy environment is critical for human health.

##### The big picture

Climate change pollution and the degradation of ecosystems are already impacting human health including through a rise in NCDs such as heart disease stroke lung cancer and respiratory diseases and undermining the capacity of health systems.
Bold climate action and investments in nature and biodiversity are vital to improve health outcomes.
The environmental challenges we face are multifaceted and ecosystem issues are interconnected.
Systems level thinking is needed to deliver better health outcomes with a lower environmental footprint.

There is increasing focus on the environmental footprint of goods and services across the whole value chain.
Companies are also under greater scrutiny reinforcing the need to have robust scientific evidence underpinning environmental targets performance reporting and the solutions being implemented.

##### Integration with our strategy and business model

We manage our Environmental protection material focus areas in an interconnected way.
Sustainable product design sourcing and manufacturing aim to achieve lower natural resource use reduced chemical and water demand and generate less waste and pollution as well as a lower GHG emissions footprint.

We follow the science to lower the economic and environmental burden of healthcare while improving health outcomes and reducing our exposure to environmental risks.
To achieve this we are accelerating the delivery of net zero healthcare proactively managing our environmental impact across all activities investing in nature and biodiversity and assessing and managing both risks and opportunities.
At AstraZeneca we are demonstrating that this can be achieved alongside business growth but there is more to do.
By investing in new ways of working and through innovative collaborations we can maximise the efficiency of how we use natural resources to further reduce our footprint.

##### Natural Resource Efficiency Fund

To drive our climate action initiatives and meet our environmental targets we have a dedicated Natural Resource Efficiency Fund (NREF) which has invested approximately $175 million in environmental efficiency projects since 2015.
This together with other central capital investments has seen a further $36.6 million spent in 2023 including 72 new projects.

##### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

We support the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework which we have applied annually since 2020.
All our business operations worldwide are in scope unless otherwise stated.
The framework applies a risk based approach focusing on the most material physical and transitional risks and opportunities.
We will build resilience across the value chain through adaptation and business continuity planning.

###### A TCFD Steering Group with cross-functional

membership has oversight of the physical and transitional risks and opportunities posed to AstraZeneca by climate change.
The identification and assessment of climate risk forms part of our existing risk management processes.
In many cases mitigation measures are already in place including for the risks and opportunities presented by the transition to a low carbon economy and the provision of net zero healthcare.
Based on current assessments physical and transitional climate related risks are included within a specific risk in the Group's risk landscape ‘Failure to meet regulatory or ethical expectations on environmental impact including climate change’ which is not currently considered to be a Principal Risk for the Group.

For further details on TCFD please see pages 51-53 in the Annual Report 2023 and our TCFD Report on www.astrazeneca.

##### Environmental Management System

Our Code of Ethics guides our behaviours and states that we operate in an environmentally responsible manner working to minimise our reliance and impact on natural resources and promote environmental sustainability as well as minimising the environmental impact of our products from discovery to disposal.
The guide for our Environmental Management System is embedded in our Code of Ethics supported by our Safety Health and Environment (SHE) Standard.
This Standard sets out the principles central to our workplace under AstraZeneca's Code of Ethics and Global Policy Framework (GPF) together with our OneSHE Framework of internal standards procedures and guidelines.

Our SHE management system is implemented in line with recognised international standards such as ISO 14001 and 50001.
It ensures the environmental risks of our activities are assessed operational controls are in place checks are completed through a risk based audit programme guided by an independent organisation and there is an annual management review process.

##### Governance

Our executive led Ambition Zero Carbon Governance Group is accountable for the delivery of Ambition Zero Carbon across all three of our Environmental protection focus areas.
In 2023 this Governance Group included our CEO CFO and the EVP Global Operations IT & Chief Sustainability Officer.

Since 2021 delivery of Ambition Zero Carbon Scope 1 and 2 commitments has been included in our executive incentive arrangements for the Performance Share Plan (PSP) with a weighting of 10% of award.
This measure reflects the importance of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on the way to achieving our verified science based target of a 98% reduction by 2026 from the 2015 baseline.
GHG emissions are calculated in line with the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol methodology for accounting and reporting of our emissions footprint.
The PSP is determined by the Board's Remuneration Committee and approved by the Annual General Meeting.

#### Ambition Zero Carbon

##### Scope of this focus area

Across our value chain

- • To achieve net zero by avoiding GHG emissions through our product and facility design, optimising energy efficiency, shifting to renewable energy sources, transitioning to a battery electric vehicle (BEV) fleet, and investing in nature-based removals to compensate for any residual GHG footprint

packaging distribution patient use and disposal.
Pharmaceutical products have a long development cycle which makes it critical to design in and embed climate considerations at an early stage.
To achieve our goals we must also tackle emissions from our existing commercial portfolio which creates challenges with heavily regulated production processes the risks and opportunities presented by climate change

- • We follow the science to understand the climate and health nexus and set our targets

- • We follow a hierarchy to address each emission source (eliminate-reduce-substitute)

- • We recognise the importance of our supply chain and suppliers, whom we engage with, educate, support and incentivise to act

and materials.

To develop an effective response we need to increase a shared understanding with our

| suppliers investing time to help align with our expectations across our supply chain. By enabling suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions we can reduce our own Scope 3 emissions and achieve our net zero targets. | [object Object]

- • To build resilience by managing the physical (sites, supply chain) and transitional (regulatory, technological, market and reputational) risks and opportunities arising from climate change and in a low-carbon economy, through adaptation and business continuity planning

##### Why it matters

We are working to deliver net zero healthcare acknowledging that approximately 5% of GHG emissions are from the healthcare sector.

Other challenges include difficulties in accessing renewable sources of heat exacerbated by the energy crisis and the relative immaturity of commercial scale clean heat solutions.
The global transition to BEVs is being impeded by a lack of vehicles and charging infrastructure in some markets although the supply of vehicles has improved and we are on plan to transition by the end of 2025 where technically feasible.

##### Strategic approach

##### Through our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy,

we are pursuing ambitious science based decarbonisation targets accelerating our progress towards net zero and managing • We have nature based and technical measures in place to identify and address physical climate risks at site level and in local business continuity planning • We focus on delivering absolute reductions in all our direct and indirect GHG emissions sources across the value chain Scopes 1 2 and 3

###### Actions – key initiatives:

####### Energy efficiency and renewable energy

In 2023 we invested $33.7 million in energy efficiency and on‑site renewable energy through the NREF together with other central capital investments to progress towards our targets.
We have achieved a 17.5% absolute reduction in total energy consumption from our 2015 baseline and we are committed to using 100% renewable energy sources to meet all our needs by the end of 2025.
As part of our renewable energy strategy we investigated how to maximise the positive impact of our renewable energy procurement and identified three focus areas for development to align with our ambition to lead in sustainability

- • Additionality – investments and energy purchase agreements that deliver on-site or new-to-grid renewable energy capacity. We are aiming for over half of our renewable energy globally to come from new sources

- • Geographic relevance – energy purchase agreements that deliver real world GHG emissions reductions by displacing fossil energy sources in the grid systems where we consume that energy

- • Temporal relevance – energy attribute certificates (EACs) that are tagged with the time and date of generation can improve the utilisation of renewable energy sources and deliver real world GHG emissions reductions. We are aiming to better understand, disclose and improve the alignment between when our energy is generated and consumed

Clean power In 2021 we transitioned to 100% imported electricity from certified renewable sources through purchasing certificates from the same country and same year as our consumption.
As we were unable to purchase renewable electricity certificates for Russia in 2022 this reduced to 99% and has been maintained in 2023. We are members of the Eurelectric led 24/7 taskforce to learn about measuring and improving the temporal relevance of our energy procurement.

We recognise the many benefits of self generated renewables to site energy costs resilience temporal relevance and employee engagement and have spent $19.4 million from 2022 to 2023 on on site solar photovoltaic (PV) installations at nine locations in seven countries.

Once operational the total output from all our on site solar PV will be 32 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity equivalent to over 4.1% of our global electricity use.
There is a limit to the scale that can be achieved through on site solar PV and so to deliver additional renewables with geographic and temporal relevance as outlined above we are aiming to meet most of our electricity needs in our primary locations Sweden UK and US through new power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the grids where we operate.

To this end in 2023 we entered into a 10 year PPA agreement with Statkraft Europe's largest renewable energy producer to source electricity from a wind farm in Sweden that will supply 200 GWh per year from a new to grid project.
This provides additional zero carbon electricity to the grid and will correspond to approximately 80% of our total electricity needs at our Gothenburg and Sodertalje sites.

Clean heat Access to certified low‑ and zero‑carbon fuels and imported heating and cooling sources globally is very limited.

###### We are striving to develop new sustainable sources of energy to achieve our Ambition

Zero Carbon targets.

Our approach to each of our locations prioritises demand reduction in the first instance and the assessment of electrification options such as heat pumps and electric boilers while also looking at substitution of fossil fuels (mostly gas) with sustainable alternative fuels and a preference for innovative and new to grid solutions.

Since 2022 we have been developing a solution for our US sites which are collectively our largest consuming market for fossil gas globally.
In 2023 we collaborated with Vanguard Renewables to enable the delivery of renewable natural gas (RNG biomethane) to all our sites in the contiguous US by the end of 2026.
From June 2023 we began purchasing RNG produced by Vanguard Renewables for our Newark campus in Delaware and by 2026 this collaboration will enable up to 190 GWh per year of RNG to be used across AstraZeneca's US sites equivalent to 36% of our total global gas consumption.

In 2023 we entered into a 15 year agreement with Future Biogas to establish the first unsubsidised industrial scale supply of biomethane in the UK.
This supply of green gas will contribute to heat for our sites in Macclesfield Cambridge Luton and Speke.
The new biomethane plant will add renewable energy capacity to existing UK infrastructure and supply more than 100 GWh of biomethane equivalent to 19% of our total global gas consumption.
Using crops grown locally as part of diverse crop rotations the plant will also contribute to the development of a circular economy supporting UK farms with sustainable land management practices.

We need to increase shared understanding with our suppliers investing time to help align with our expectations across our supply chain.

Value chain collaboration

Through the SMI Health Systems Task Force convened by AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot we are partnering across the healthcare sector to accelerate the delivery of net zero health systems including through supply chain decarbonisation and patient care pathways and the use of digital innovation in clinical research.

Ahead of COP28 in November to accelerate the transition to net zero health systems it was announced that global healthcare leaders from the Task Force were in advanced discussions with energy providers in China and India to scale renewable power across their supply chains in an industry‑first initiative in these countries.
China and India are key markets for pharmaceuticals manufacturing estimated to account for up to 50% of materials for medicines.

In January 2024 it was announced that AstraZeneca was one of five global healthcare leaders including four members of the SMI to sign an industry‑first renewable power agreement in China with leading renewable

energy company Envision Energy resulting in potential annual carbon dioxide equivalent savings of approximately 120 kilotonnes.

In March 2023 the Task Force announced joint minimum climate and sustainability targets for suppliers to address emissions across the value chain and reduce the complexity of multiple asks for suppliers.
In July 2023 AstraZeneca's CEO was one of seven global healthcare leaders in the Task Force who signed an open letter calling on suppliers to sign up to these targets and play their part in decarbonising the healthcare value chain.

We also joined other global pharmaceutical companies in accelerating the decarbonisation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supply chains helping suppliers gain access to green funding and support through the Activate Programme.

We were a founding member of Energize a collaboration between Schneider Electric and 19 global pharmaceutical companies to facilitate access to renewable power at scale for our suppliers with the programme's first PPA buyers’ cohort to purchase 2 TWh renewable electricity announced in November 2022. To date 286 AstraZeneca suppliers have registered with the programme.
In 2023 a partnership was announced between Energize and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy across the pharmaceutical sector supply chain to support the transition to net zero.

We are tackling 20% of our Scope 3 footprint through our commitment to developing a next generation pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using the propellant HFO 1234ze(E) which has a near zero Global Warming Potential (GWP see details below in Product sustainability key initiatives.

We are working to build transparent supply chains by asking our partners to assess and disclose their GHG emissions to the CDP Supply Chain Programme with 708 suppliers (59% of in scope spend).

Product sustainability

##### Scope of this focus area

To follow processes throughout the life cycle of our products with the aim of understanding and addressing their environmental impact from discovery through development and production to launch of a new product and to end of product life.

We follow a life cycle approach that covers all stages of our products

####### API production and formulation

####### Distribution

Sustainable decision making and environmental improvements are embedded across the product life cycle

######## Disposal (end-of-life or reuse)

######## Patient use

######### Device production

######### Packaging

##### Why it matters

People and the planet will benefit from those medicines which have the smallest possible environmental impact yet maintain the highest medical efficacy and safety standards.
As technologies and healthcare systems evolve so should solutions to reduce energy water material use waste and pollution generated from designing manufacturing and delivering medicines to patients.
We know that the GHG emissions from our product value chains are the most significant contribution to our company Scope 3 emissions and we are addressing these across our business using a data driven approach.

###### Actions – key initiatives:

F-gas regulatory developments and next generation pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI)

Pharmaceuticals enter the environment mainly from patient use where some can pass through our bodies and into waterways.
APIs are biologically active molecules and may interact with and impact wildlife when in the environment.
Drug manufacture and the improper disposal of unused medicines can also add to the trace levels of pharmaceuticals in rivers lakes soils and sometimes drinking water.
We recognise that even in very low concentrations the risks associated with Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PIE) should be determined and managed.
With increased access to medicines worldwide and an ageing population potentially more patients will pass pharmaceutical residues into the environment.

More details of our approach can be found in our position statement on Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PIE).

- • Integrated business processes to ensure safety, health and environmental

aspects are considered throughout drug development with guidance on environmental assessment of API manufacturing formulation packaging and devices • Targets for API manufacturing emissions from both AstraZeneca and our external supply sites • We conduct fund and support research on the environmental impact of our products and apply the principles of green chemistry in our business • Our life cycle assessment (LCA) programme determines the type and magnitude of environmental impacts across our product value chains and is in line with ISO standards

Essential medicines for respiratory diseases include pMDIs which rely on fluorinated gases (F-gases) as propellants.
Driven by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol governments are developing legislation to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) a type of F-gas.
AstraZeneca supports the phase down of these high Global Warming Potential (GWP) propellants and recognises the significant positive impact it could have on climate and health.
It is critical however that legislation avoids the risk of limiting access to life saving inhaled medicines for patients thereby protecting both people and planet.

An important product related element of our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy is our commitment to developing a next generation pMDI using the propellant HFO 1234ze(E) which has near zero GWP.
In 2023 project milestones achieved include further Phase III investment decisions a harmonised development programme defined globally readouts of pivotal studies and initiation of key studies needed to file for regulatory approval.

##### Strategic approach

To deliver medicines that improve patient outcomes and minimise the burden on the planet we evaluate and aim to address the environmental impact of materials and processes across the entire product value chain.

14040 and 14044 • We invest in new science and disruptive technologies allowing design of shorter

chemical sequences to our APIs and improve processes for our new modality medicines significantly reducing environmental impact • We are working on redesigning our packaging to make it more sustainable • We are a leading partner in collaborations to drive common standards for illustrating environmental footprints of our medicines

We have implemented an internal Product Sustainability Index (PSI) to understand the environmental impacts of our products and inform improvement plans.
We also lead our industry in the management of PIE and promote responsible product stewardship.

European Union (EU) pharmaceutical and chemicals regulatory developments

As part of the European Commission's pollution reduction strategy updates and changes to pharmaceutical and chemical regulations could influence the way medicines are manufactured and approved in future.
Monitoring these regulatory risks providing evidence based responses to ongoing consultations and proactively managing the chemicals used in our processes including those categorised as per‑ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will help minimise the impact on supply of medicines to patients.

Life cycle assessments for pharmaceuticals Recognising the importance of a harmonised method to measure and report the environmental impact of medicines and healthcare products the SMI Health Systems Task Force has worked with the Pharmaceutical Environment Group (PEG) through a newly created consortium and NHS England to support the development of a sector wide standard for medicines LCA. The consortium and NHS England intend to work with the British Standards Institution (BSI) to reach a consensus among the sector's stakeholder groups including healthcare systems providers and professionals representative bodies academics and patients to establish the standard.
With support from experts including Quantis the delivery of this LCA standard will improve transparency and support the assessment and reduction of the environmental impact of medicines across their manufacture supply use and end of product life.

###### Ecopharmacovigilance (EPV)

####### Ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) is our approach

to understanding pharmaceuticals in the environment.
Our EPV process reviews emerging science and literature looking for new information that might change the way we assess the environmental risks associated with our APIs.
Our industry leading dashboard where users can visualise the relative risks of our APIs that are found in the environment is available on our website.

###### Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) PREMIER

As part of our commitment to drive thought leadership and innovation to manage PIE we are the industry lead of the IHI PREMIER consortium a public private partnership between the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).
We are helping develop tools to identify potential environmental risks of APIs and make these tools and data more accessible to all stakeholders.
In 2023 PREMIER published an evidence led prioritisation for environmental data generation an important step aimed at significantly reducing reliance on fish studies.

As part of our engagement with the IHI AstraZeneca has joined a coalition of pharmaceutical companies to co-fund a major initiative to progress the sustainable manufacture of healthcare products and their quantitative environmental impact due to start in 2024.

We are part of the HORIZON ETERNAL consortium that brings 17 different companies universities and institutes together from across the EU to contribute to sustainable development of pharmaceutical manufacture use and disposal.

####### Status: Lagging

Natural resources

######### Scope of this focus area

Natural resources and the benefits that humans receive from nature are essential to produce our medicines and operate our sites.

Our circular economy approach Develop suitable metrics to monitor our progress towards a more circular economy Seek to minimise the amount of materials required and waste generated during manufacture and Incorporate the principles of the circular economy into the design of all our processes and products from initial research and development through to production

Where possible regenerate nature and use renewable natural resources instead of non renewable ones use of our products

We are committed to

- • Reducing our impact on the planet through responsible sourcing and efficient, circular use and disposal of natural resources across the value chain

- • Protecting and restoring ecosystems to improve health outcomes and tackle environmental drivers of disease, such as water and air quality, through our focus on water stewardship and biodiversity

######### Why it matters

We recognise that a healthy environment is inextricably linked to the health of people and society and we need to operate within our planetary boundaries for a healthy planet.
We are taking action to protect and restore ecosystems by limiting environmental impacts across our value chain investing in nature and water stewardship and protecting biodiversity on and around our sites.
The conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and the protection and restoration of ecosystems are vital to shape a healthy future with resilient people and communities building harmony between society and the natural environment.

Maximise proportion of waste recycled and aim to eliminate waste to landfill Increase reused or recycled content of the materials we use (both directly and in our supply chain) To do this we are leveraging our experience with lean manufacturing which includes tools to enhance efficiency and eliminate waste and embedding recognised best practices from partners such as My Green Lab into our business as usual.
These efforts empower employees across our global network to identify and implement ideas that contribute to our environmental targets.

Our key targets aim to decouple water use and waste generation from business growth supported by efficiency projects partnership and engagement with suppliers and designing Supply chains from the pharmaceutical sector are highly complex making it difficult to define our impacts and dependencies on nature and prioritise mitigating actions especially because local conditions often necessitate unique solutions for shared challenges.
Many materials needed to produce medicines are hazardous in nature and difficult to replace generating waste streams that are challenging to reuse recycle or repurpose.
These factors mean cross sectoral collaboration with suppliers regulators and other companies and organisations are needed to address the growing threats and changes to local ecosystems that our business relies upon.

######### Strategic approach

We are committed to reducing our impact on the planet and investing in nature and biodiversity to benefit planetary and societal health.
We recognise that adopting circular business approaches and implementing efficient processes to develop and produce our medicines are key to reducing natural resources used in our value chains.

| Moving beyond efficiency within our direct operations we are working in collaboration with key stakeholders including our ongoing collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Sweden to make positive contributions to nature and local communities near our sites while mitigating risks from a changing climate. We are also working to embed emerging best practice into our own operations and across our supply chain for example using tools and guidance that Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) is developing to set long term science led water and biodiversity targets that are informed by local context by 2025. We are also furthering our commitment to assess and minimise environmental impacts from our supply chain. While making progress on our existing responsible sourcing targets to create action plans for identified key raw materials of natural origin we are building a risk based approach to assess additional new and existing materials’ impacts and dependencies on nature. This is helping prepare us for future reporting to the Taskforce on Nature related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework where we have announced we will be an early adopter.

Inclusion and diversity

##### Scope of this focus area

To create a working environment where every employee has a sense of belonging and feels valued for the contribution they make regardless of age sex disability ethnicity gender identity or re-assignment nationality pregnancy race religion sexual orientation country of origin or other forms of diversity.
This includes equitable reward and opportunities for development and advancement.
Additionally our Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) priorities extend to AstraZeneca's value chain through supplier diversity efforts that enhance our socio economic impact in local communities.

##### Why it matters

We believe that inclusion is a right and diversity is a strength.
Both make a fundamental contribution to the success of our Company because innovation requires breakthrough ideas that only come from a diverse workforce empowered to challenge conventional thinking.
Our ongoing commitment to I&D underpins our ability to maintain a sustainable workforce by ensuring that we continue to attract develop and retain top talent from various backgrounds and with different experiences.
Every component of our I&D mission is critical to our success.

##### Strategic approach

Our approach to I&D prioritises efforts in areas where we can drive lasting systemic change for our organisation and for society.

Our global I&D strategy includes three strategic focus areas that guide how inclusion diversity and belonging are embedded within the entire ecosystem in which AstraZeneca exists from our employees to our patients and to local communities and beyond.
They include

- • Inclusion: Cultivate inclusion and belonging

- • Diversity: Build and sustain a diverse leadership and talent pipeline

- • Impact: Advance societal change

We recognise that everyone plays a role and our global I&D ecosystem engages a diverse cross section of colleagues and suppliers.
Our Global I&D Ambassador Group comprises senior and rising leaders who are representative of our global workforce and organisational structure with our CEO Pascal Soriot as Executive Sponsor.
This group is accountable for advising on and enhancing organisational progress towards our global I&D ambitions as well as working with local leaders to ensure an approach that is tailored to meet local needs.

I&D is central to our commitment to being a great place to work for the benefit of our employees our business and for society.

##### Actions – key initiatives

###### Global Power of Diversity

Each year we recognise celebrate and learn more about the rich diversity within our organisation and the power we can unlock by utilising it.
Since its inception in 2020 Power of Diversity has become an internal movement with global and local events communications and initiatives taking place year round engaging our entire workforce.

The power of our diversity drives innovation and allows us to push the boundaries of science to deliver life changing medicines to patients.

###### Accelerating Supplier Diversity

Our Supplier Diversity Programme maximises opportunities for small and diverse businesses to be part of our value chain and supports their growth.
This helps support local economies through job opportunities enabling diverse supplier development through mentorship schemes (36 mentee companies in 2023) and making a positive socio economic impact by supporting the growth of local businesses in underrepresented communities.
Our programme aimed to launch in 10 countries outside of the US by 2025 and we reached this goal two years early.
The programme is now active in 10 countries outside of the US including Brazil South Africa UK Australia New Zealand Poland Sweden and most recently launched in Switzerland Ireland and Canada in 2023.

To support our diverse suppliers to make progress on sustainability in 2023 we extended our Diverse Supplier Sustainability Accelerator Programme and Climate Action Series to 230 small and diverse suppliers to help them increase their sustainability capabilities.
Supplier diversity partnerships include WEConnect International Minority Supplier Development UK Social Enterprise UK National Minority Supplier Development Council NGLCC National HubZone Council WBEC East and WBEC Greater DMV Disability:IN and the Diversity Alliance for Science.
We were a founding member of the European Supplier Diversity Project (ESDP) a collaboration effort between MSD UK and 14 global companies to establish supplier diversity across Europe and empower ethnic minority owned businesses across European markets.

Workforce safety and health

##### Scope of this focus area

To provide a safe and healthy working environment based on a culture of learning and improvement rather than blame.
This includes the application of human and operational performance principles including training for leaders and managers supporting employee health through flexible ways of working access to disease prevention treatment and mental health services.

##### Why it matters

To continue to deliver medicines to patients we must foster an environment where people feel safe energised and inspired.
The resources we put into supporting the physical and mental health and safety of our workforce are an investment in society at large the communities where we operate and their long term economic health.
Contributing to a safe and healthy environment is the right thing to do and can also have positive business impacts in terms of productivity.

##### Strategic approach

Through our Global Standards we are committed to maintaining or exceeding compliance with all local company legal and regulatory requirements.
Our (SHE) Standard is covered by our Code of Ethics and supported by our OneSHE Framework and accompanying ‘SHE Everybody's Business’ training which establishes minimum standards and is applicable to all employees temporary staff and contractors across AstraZeneca sites and all business areas and functions.
We work with regulators vendors and our own Legal function to ensure we maintain compliance within the various local regulatory frameworks that apply.

We manage SHE risks opportunities and performance by using effective management systems utilising a ‘Plan Do Check Act’ process to ensure continuous improvement.
This requires engagement throughout the organisation effective leadership open communication and a commitment from every employee to themselves our colleagues our workplace our community and our environment.

Our AZ SHE System provides a single transparent source of SHE data across our enterprise.
This drives innovation in the management and reporting of SHE events and sustainability metrics.
By collecting data from 504 locations and 81 countries on SHE events (including near misses) SHE observations and SHE inspections in one system we have quick notification of and response to events and we can trend our safety health and environmental performance.
This further enables us to ensure safety and health initiatives are focused on the right areas and implement corrective and preventive action plans.

##### Actions – key initiatives

SHE compliance with local legislation In 2023 we have increased our focus to assure compliance with local SHE legislation as well as company Global SHE standards.
We have partnered with an external vendor to scan for SHE regulatory changes and provide a platform for most of our Operations and R&D sites to document compliance.

Preventing serious injury and fatality at work We launched a Serious Injury and Fatality Prevention and Mitigation Programme in 2021 led by our Global SHE team and guided by a senior level steering committee.
Process and life safety subject matter experts evaluate high risk activities with the potential to result in a serious injury or fatality and prioritise these against internal audit findings and past events.
In 2023 we implemented the final year of our three year plan to address 12 high risk areas focusing on process safety management explosive atmospheres and instrumented protective systems.
Besides reviewing and uplifting existing standards and materials followed by a gap assessment at site level we have now also included questions for leaders to ask during routine workplace interactions to provide process confirmation.
This involves leaders watching the process and engaging with those who do the work to learn if there are further improvement opportunities.
The successful approach to focus on hazardous activities is now being built into existing ways of working ensuring sustainable implementation and continuous improvement.

Drive Success driver safety campaign to protect employees and communities As outlined in the Sustainability Report 2022 AstraZeneca responded to an increasing collision trend by developing a safe driving campaign and training programme endorsed by the Commercial SHE Executive Committee.
This campaign continued into 2023 and has shown a positive impact on collisions per million kilometres (CPMK).
In 2023 the CPMK was 1.96 exceeding the 2.5 target for the year and on course to meet or exceed the target for 2025 of 1.90.
