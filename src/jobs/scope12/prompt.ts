  - Extract values only if explicitly available in the context. Do not infer or create data. Leave optional fields absent or explicitly set to null if no data is provided.
  
  Extract scope 1 and 2 emissions according to the GHG protocol (CO2e). Include all years you can find and never exclude the latest year.
  Include market-based and location-based in scope 2. If you can't find both, include the one you can find and set the other to null.
  
  **Units**:
  - Always report emissions in metric tons (**tCO2e** or **tCO2**). The unit **tCO2e** (tons of CO2 equivalent) is preferred.
  - If a company explicitly reports emissions without the "e" suffix (e.g., **tCO2**), use **tCO2** as the unit. However, if no unit is specified or it is unclear, assume the unit is **tCO2e**.
  - All values must be converted to metric tons if they are provided in other units:
    - Example: 
      - 1000 CO2e → 1 tCO2e
      - 1000 CO2 → 1 tCO2
      - 1 kton CO2e → 1000 tCO2e
      - 1 Mton CO2 → 1,000,000 tCO2
  - Use **tCO2** only if it is explicitly reported without the "e" suffix, otherwise default to **tCO2e**.
  - If you get some variation of the unit in metric tons, CO2e, CO2, or tCO2e, tCO2, tCO2e, use the wording **tCO2e** (with the "e" suffix).

  
  NEVER CALCULATE ANY EMISSIONS. ONLY REPORT THE DATA AS IT IS IN THE PDF. If you can't find any data or if you are uncertain, report it as null. Do not use markdown in the output.

        - Example: 
          - 1000 CO2e → 1 tCO2e
          - 1000 CO2 → 1 tCO2
          - 1 kton CO2e → 1000 tCO2e
          - 1 Mton CO2 → 1,000,000 tCO2
      - Use **tCO2** only if it is explicitly reported without the "e" suffix, otherwise default to **tCO2e**.
    
      Always expand abbreviated units to their full numerical value. Convert:
    
    X thousand tons → X × 1,000 tons
    X million tons → X × 1,000,000 tons
    etc.
    Example: '3.1 thousand tons' should become '3,100 tons', not be left as '3.1 thousand tons
    
    
      - If there is any mention of location based or market based anywhere in the document, add the quote from the document in mentionOfLocationBasedOrMarketBased.
    
    - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Do not assume any method and DO NOT infer if it is location based or market based based on energy use or other information, just use their explicit method statement to decide if you put values in the field for lb (location-based), mb (market-based), both or unknown. 
    - CRITICAL RULE: If the document states they use a methodology IN GENERAL (e.g., "we use market-based approach"), then ALL scope 2 values in that document are classified with that method. You do NOT need individual values to be labeled - the general statement applies to everything.
    - ONLY use "unknown" if NO methodology is mentioned ANYWHERE in the document.  - ALWAYS PUT THE VALUES IN THE UNKNOWN FIELD IF NO METHOD IS MENTIONED: "No method is mentioned, so the values are put in the unknown field."
    
    - FORBIDDEN REASONING: Never say "specific value is not labeled" or "value not explicitly stated as market-based" - this reasoning is incorrect and forbidden.
    
    
      - Fill in explanationOfWhyYouPutValuesToMbOrLbOrUnknown with a short explanation of why you put the values in the field for mb (market-based), lb (location-based) or unknown. Then put the values in the corresponding field.
    
      IMPORTANT: 
      1. First: fill in mentionOfLocationBasedOrMarketBased, try to find a quote from the document. Make sure to include both methods if both are stated!
      2. Second: Use that to create an explanation for explanationOfWhyYouPutValuesToMbOrLbOrUnknown. IMPORTANT: A general method applies to all values so if they have mention using market-based, then all values are market-based. They do not have to state a method for each specific value.
      3. Third:Only after that you put the values in the corresponding field. 
    
      For any fiscal year notation (2015/16, FY16, etc.), always use the ENDING year (2016) in your output.

  - Extract values only if explicitly available in the context. Do not infer or create data. Leave optional fields absent or explicitly set to null if no data is provided.
  
    Extract scope 1 and 2 emissions according to the GHG protocol (CO2e). Include all years you can find and never exclude the latest year.
  If you have found a value for scope 2, you must do this:
  - Check if they mention anywhere that they use a market based or location based method.
  
  Include market-based and location-based in scope 2. If you can't find both, include the one you can find and set the other to null.
  
  
  **Units**:
  - Always report emissions in metric tons (**tCO2e** or **tCO2**). The unit **tCO2e** (tons of CO2 equivalent) is preferred.
  - All variations of tons like, thousands of tons, millions of tons, kton, Mton, etc. should be converted to metric tons. Also convert the value to the unit factor in that case.
  - Example: "a value that is 31.2 specified at thousands of tons, should be converted to 31200t and added as 31200 to the scope 2 value"
  - If you see mention of them using some factor of "tons', you must convert the value, multiply with the factor to get to "tons".
  - If a company explicitly reports emissions without the "e" suffix (e.g., **tCO2**), use **tCO2** as the unit. However, if no unit is specified or it is unclear, assume the unit is **tCO2e**.
  - All values must be converted to metric tons if they are provided in other units:
    - Example: 
      - 1000 CO2e → 1 tCO2e
      - 1000 CO2 → 1 tCO2
      - 1 kton CO2e → 1000 tCO2e
      - 1 Mton CO2 → 1,000,000 tCO2
  - Use **tCO2** only if it is explicitly reported without the "e" suffix, otherwise default to **tCO2e**.

  Always expand abbreviated units to their full numerical value. Convert:

X thousand tons → X × 1,000 tons
X million tons → X × 1,000,000 tons
etc.
