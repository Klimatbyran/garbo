#### Overview of XVIVO’s GHG emissions in 2024 by source of emissions

In percentage of total emissions Scope 3 99%

Scope 2 0.6% Scope 1 0.4%

##### Pollution
##### Circularity Own workforce

Workers in the value chain Affected communities Consumers & end users Business conduct

#### Environment

XVIVO is committed to supplying safe sustainable products and ensuring compliance with laws regulations and standards where the environment plays a key role.
Due to strict sterility requirements a prerequisite for guaranteeing patient safety is that the reuse of materials is prohibited as clearly stipulated by the WHO.
Because our disposable products cannot be reused due to biological contamination this means that using our products has a degree of environ mental impact.

XVIVO has an Environmental policy in place which can be found on our website (www. xvivogroup.com).
15,451 tCO2e In 2024 we conducted our first green house gas (GHG) emission collection and calculation using the methodology of the Green House Gas Protocol.
Scope 3 emissions accounts for an absolute majority 99% of total emissions primarily a result from emissions from pur chased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution.

Our environmental work focuses on three areas where we have the opportunity to influence our environmental impact through responsible decisions facilities partners and logistics.

Our greatest contribution to a better world XVIVO's ESRS focus areas*

|  |
| --- |
| Our greatest contribution to sustainability is creating opportunities to save more lives enhance the quality of life for patients and improve healthcare economics so that healthcare systems all over the world can afford to do even more. Our core business is based on our vision that ‘nobody should die waiting for a new organ’. XVIVO's profits are largely reinvested in research and develop ment. In 2024 about 32 percent of revenues were reinvested in R&D projects and mainte nance with the aim of improving transplant care by bringing new lifesaving products to the market in the future. High quality and safety of our products is critical to our operations. | We ensure quality and safety through compli ance with applicable laws and regulations and our process based quality management system. In preparation for the Corporate Sustainability Responsibility Directive (CSRD) the upcoming new EU directive for sustainability reporting XVIVO has conducted a double materiality assessment (DMA) in 2024. The assessment looks at XVIVO's impact on environment and people referred to as impact materiality alongside their impact on XVIVO known as financial materiality. The assessed topics are defined in the Europeans Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) and the outcome of the DMA will be the basis of XVIVO's sustainability work going forward.

####### 47XVIVO ANNUAL REPORT 2024


<!-- PAGE: 47 -->
In XVIVOs largest market the US legislation has been established aimed at ensuring that financial relationships and transactions with the healthcare sector are reported to the authorities.
This takes place through the Open Payments Program (the Sunshine Act).
The information is public and publication of XVIVO's data enables the company's financial transactions within this sector to be assessed with full transparency by an external party.
Similar legislation exists in many of our major markets primarily in the EU which ensures transparency in our transactions.

Employees and external stakeholders can report suspected or detected misconduct to an external whistleblower function via our website.

Data integrity and IT security Cyberthreats have become a serious problem for companies and can significantly impact both the organization and personal privacy.
XVIVO works actively with security related to IT systems and sensitive data.
We collect patient data in our clinical trials.
We do our utmost to ensure that this data is processed confidentially and that personal privacy is always protected.
Our clinical trials are conducted in accordance with ISO14155 and GCP and all data processing takes place in accordance with the GDPR.
Data from our clinical trials are collected and stored in electronic data collection systems that are certified for or compatible with relevant certifications (ISO27001 ISO9001) and/or national or international standards (HIPAA NEN7510) for data processing and security.

Setting the stage for ESG work in 2025 In 2024 we laid the foundation for extending our strategic and systematic sustainability work to further strengthen our positive impact on our surrounding world.

The DMA and its outcome carried out together with a leading Nordic sustainability partner forms the basis for our sustainability focus in the short and long term.
The DMA is a key component of our long term corporate strategy and will be updated annually.

Based on the outcome of the DMA a broader plan was set in place to outline our sustain ability work in the upcoming years by con ducting an analysis of our sustainability activities and governance.
Based on the analysis we developed a roadmap of sustainability activities to strengthen our existing sustainability capabilities in the coming years.

We conducted a resilience assessment to judge how well XVIVO can withstand or adapt to risks and challenges to ensure long term sustainability and operational stability.
As part XVIVO's broader effort to strengthen our ESG resilience and capabilities we are conducting mapping of our environmental impact.
Example of the work done is a full GHG emission screening including all scopes and identification of relevant categories in scope 3.
In 2025 we will continue this effort with mapping of eg
decarbonization activities.

Aligned with rest of the sustainability work we have done further assessment of existing sustainability governance to integrate future initiatives more into our core business and operations.

### Note 3. Operating segments

|  |
|  |
| The Group's business is divided up into operating segments on the basis of what parts of the business the company's chief operating decision maker follows up in a management approach. | The following operating segments have been identified • Thoracic Sales of lung and heart transplant products. •Abdominal Sales of liver and kidney transplant products. •Services Revenue from sales of services in organ recovery
![table image]({page: 78, x: 465}, {y: 82, {width: 366}, {height: 47})

Group management follows up the sales and gross margin of the business and makes decisions regarding the distribution of resources on the basis of the goods and services the Group develops and sells in the respective segments.

The Group's internal reporting is thus constructed so that Group management can follow up all goods’ performance.
It is on the basis of this internal reporting that the Group's segments have been identified as the various parts have under gone a process that has aimed at combining segments that are similar.

|  | Thoracic | Abdominal | Services | Consolidated total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Disposables | 539,237 | 372,518 | 154,829 | 118,342 | - | -694,066 490,860 |  |

![table image]({page: 78, x: 124}, {y: 246, {width: 400}, {height: 8})

The segments’ gross profit includes directly attributable costs and costs that can be divided up into segments in a reasonable and reliable manner.
The items recognized in the segments’ gross income are measured in accordance with the gross margin that Group management follows up.

Lena Hoglund Board member

Our audit report was issued on April 2 2025

########### Auditor’s responsibility

Our objective concerning the audit of the adminis tration and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect

- • has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or

- • in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.

Our objective concerning the audit of the pro posed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and thereby our opinion about this is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.

As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
The examination of the administration and the pro posed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts.
Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality.
This means that we focus the examination on such actions areas and relation ships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company's situation.

#### Flexible products for machine perfusion of donated livers

XVIVO's offering in liver transplantation comprises the proprietary machine Liver Assist with related disposables.
The machine includes a pump that handles perfusion of the organ a heating unit that regulates tempera ture and an oxygenator.

Liver Assist is used at the recipient hospital either for Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion (HOPE) ie
cold perfusion or for normother mic ie
warm assessment of donated livers.
In addition the machine can also be used for sub-normothermic perfusion or for a combi nation of cold and warm perfusion.
The temperature and protocol used depends on the organ and clinical preferences.
Liver Assist is CE marked under MDR.
In January 2025 XVIVO submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the FDA seeking approval to initiate a clinical study for Liver Assist in the US.
The study is expected to commence in 2025.

Kidney transplantation For patients with chronic kidney failure there are two treatment alternatives transplantation or dialysis.
Transplantation is the best option primarily for the patient's quality of life and survival1 but also from a socioeconomic perspective since the alternative dialysis is both costly and resource intensive.
An estimated 4 million patients receive dialysis globally.
Of these 800,000 are in the US alone where the estimated cost is approximately 7,000 USD per month per dialysis patient.2

Significant risks and uncertainties

There are several risk factors which impact XVIVO's business and which may do so in the future.

The risks are presented in the following areas

- • Market risks

- • Operational risks

- • Legal and regulatory risks

- • Global health crises and conflicts

- • Financial risks

Market risk Lung transplantations are a life saving proce dure for which there are no medical treatment alternatives.
The shortage of organs is signifi cant and there is potential within healthcare systems to improve efficiency enabling more transplants to be performed.
The cost of trans plantation is largely offset by lower overall life saving patient treatment costs although hospitals frequently remain dependent on government reimbursement for transplantation to be financially sustainable.
Other market risks are hospital access to funding and medical resources.
In the assessment of XVIVO the business is not currently significantly impacted by changes in the world economy.
Organ transplantation is a prioritized treat ment by health authorities around the world.

Operational risks These primarily comprise risks that limit or prevent XVIVO from developing manufactur ing and selling qualitative efficient and safe products.
The risks have been identified and essentially reduced to manageable levels for example by signing agreements with suppli ers partners and customers as well as co-investments in production facilities.
XVIVO is a company of limited size and the organiza tion is still in the process of being built up.
XVIVO's future development is partly depen dent on key personnel with specialist knowl edge remaining in the organization Legal and regulatory risks The market for XVIVO is impacted by applica ble legislation and other regulations.
Changes in legislation or political decisions may impact the company's ability to run or develop the business.
XVIVO's products need regulatory approval on the markets where they are marketed.
The market for medical technology products is being regulated to an increasing extent with a view to increasing patient safety and reducing the risk of incorrect treatment.
This means increased product development costs for XVIVO but also greater barriers for new competitors who want to break into the market.

Due to the nature of the business there is a risk of claims for damages and liability.
To protect the Group against the economic effects of any claims XVIVO is insured against general and business related claims for damages.
XVIVO performs regular reviews with brokers and insurance advisors and the applicable insurance cover is presented to the Board annually.

Global health crises and conflicts Although XVIVO and the transplantation industry in general are returning significant growth there is continued uncertainty in the surrounding world.
The Covid 19 pandemic showed that global transplantation activity is negatively affected by health crises that place healthcare services under significant pressure.
Geopolitical conflict and war in the surround ing world are currently having a limited impact on XVIVO's operations both in terms of sales and the supply chain.

Financial risks XVIVO has most of its sales in other curren cies than SEK.
The US dollar and the Euro are the most important currencies.
Expenses are largely in SEK but a considerable portion is in USD.
XVIVO does not currently hedge its revenues in foreign currency which means there is a currency risk for the business (see Note 25 for further information).

Sustainability and responsibility Sustainability and responsible business practices are integral parts of XVIVO\'s strategy and corporate culture.
The company\'s focus on sustainability efforts intensified in 2024.
XVIVO has partnered with a leading sustainability consulting firm to ensure com pliance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for the 2025 financial year.
In compliance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act XVIVO has prepared a Sustainability Report included as a separate section in the Annual Report on pages 39-48.

Legal disputes The company was not involved in any legal disputes in 2024 that had any significant impact on the company's finances or business.

### Machine perfusion – a market ten times larger than traditional storage on ice Tailored service offering that supports the growth of transplant programs
## Financial targets 2027 - profitable growth
### EBIT

>20%

### Profitability is driven by the sales and utilization of disposables.

In heart transplantation we have a new pioneering preservation technology.
The technology is expected to receive regulatory approval CE marking during the first half of 2025 paving the way for its European launch.
Following the CE marking an approval application will be submitted to the regulatory authorities in Australia where we anticipate a swift process.
A clinical study for the technol ogy in the US successfully completed patient enrollment in November 2024 and we are now awaiting the one year follow up data.
The technology includes a machine dispos ables and a perfusion solution with a supplement.

## Status of regulatory approvals in key markets

- Unapproved product(s)

PMA approval for STEEN Solution & XPS / PERFADEX Plus 510(k) approval

Kidney Assist Transport 510(k) approval

##### Revenue model for Thoracic and Abdominal

In the Thoracic and Abdominal business areas profitability is driven by the sales and utiliza tion of disposables rather than by the machines sold.

Machine sales are recognized as sales of capital goods.
The goal is to expand the installed base of perfusion machines for all organs with customers looking to initiate or scale up their transplantation programs.

For each installed machine regardless of whether it is intended for preservation assessment of organs or transport dispos ables are used for each handled organ.
These disposables and solutions are considered one time use consumables comprise the business areas’ main source of income.

The gross margin is strong and amounted to 85 percent (84) for machine perfusion in

 This is some of the important tables from the markdown with more precision:

## Services business area

Organ recovery as a service Since 2021 XVIVO offers organ recovery as a service on the US market.
XVIVO is responsi ble for the removal of donor organs and for transporting them to transplant clinics where the implantation surgery is performed by the clinic's own surgeons.
XVIVO\'s surgeons are on call around the clock and have experience of more than 2,000 organ recoveries.
The current geographical service area covers the East Coast to Mid West where XVIVO currently is responsible for approximately 8% of all heart and lung recovery.

By allowing a third party to collect organs transplant clinics can focus on their patients and increase the number of transplants.
This leads to more lives being saved while reduc ing costs and saving time.
Today the compa ny\'s offering covers heart and lung services and as part of its business plan it aims to expand its service portfolio in the coming years to new geographic regions in the US while also incorporating kidney and liver services.

FlowHawk A communication platform for the transplantation process In October 2024 XVIVO acquired FlowHawk.
It is a digital tool for communication and workflow planning developed specifically for transplantation processes which includes the development and distribution of this software platform.
FlowHawk is available in the US market and is used by several major transplant clinics.
XVIVO\'s organ recovery service has implemented FlowHawk into its service offer during 2024.

Today transplant clinics often rely on traditional text messages emails and phone calls for communication which can be cumbersome and inefficient but also a security risk for sensitive patient data.
Transplant clinics need ways to remove unnecessary barriers and streamline processes in order to continue increasing the number of successful trans plants.
The FlowHawk software platform enables HIPAA compliant direct communica tion with collaborating teams ensuring that the right information reaches the right people at the right time.
Simple transparent and traceable workflows ensure that all relevant tasks are completed and decisions are logged.

#### Note 14. Intangible non-current assets (cont’d.)

Amortization has been divided by function in the Income Statement as follows

|  | Group | Parent Company |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Costs of goods sold | -52 | -90 | - | -
| Selling expenses | -6,172 | -5,992 | -23 | -23
| Administration expenses | -493 | -430 | -396 | -430
| Research and development expenses | -28,265 | -30,146 | -14,862 | -16,863
| Total | -34,982 | -36,658 | -15,281 | -17,316
![table image]({page: 90, x: 273}, {y: 105, {width: 399}, {height: 8})

The present value of forecast cash flows has been calculated using a discount rate of 11.6 percent before tax for assets in lung operations 12.6 percent before tax for heart operations 13.6 percent before tax for assets in liver operations 11.6 percent before tax for assets in kidney operations,12.6 percent for assets linked to organ recovery operations and 11.6 percent for the operations in Italy.
The recoverable amount which is calculated in the Group as value in use exceeds the carrying amount for all impairment tested assets.
Management believes that no reasonable changes in the important variables and assump tions result in the entity's recoverable amount being lower than the carrying amounts.

The Group's goodwill is attributable to acquisitions of subsidiaries and their businesses.
Goodwill primarily consists of synergy effects that do not meet the requirements for accounting as intangi ble assets at the time of the acquisition.
Primary synergies are potentially increased sales values per client as well as increased sales potential for new clients which can be achieved by utilizing XVIVO's knowledge and experience within global marketing and regulatory issues in acquired operations.
Synergies which could contribute to future net sales is also to be found within research and development.
Goodwill and capitalized expenditure have been tested for impairment on the basis of budgets and forecasts where the first year of the forecast is based on the company's budget and the subse quent four years on the basis of the historical growth rate adjusted by the company manage ment's forecasts for the future.
The forecasts have been produced internally by the company management on the basis of historical data management's cumulative experience and their best assessment of the company's development potential.
The main variables in the forecast are market growth and market share gross margin sales costs and investments.
Management\'s forecasts for market growth and market share are based on the assumption that the transplantation market will continue to expand by at least 5-7 percent annually reflecting historical growth trends.
Over time XVIVO aims to establish a market leading position in each organ segment.
Capitalized development expenses were written down by SEK 20 million during the year.
The cost was recognized under Research and development expenses.
The asset value before impairment primarily comprised internally and externally accumulated costs attributable to development work in the early stage of product development.
In 2024 management assessed that the assets in question no longer hold value for the business and have therefore been fully written down to zero.

In order to support the impairment testing of goodwill that has been carried out a comprehen sive analysis has been made of the sensitivity of the variables used in the model.
An assumed increase in the discount rate of an additional 5 percentage points demonstrates that the recover able amounts are still greater than the carrying amounts.
Other assumptions such as the gross margin capital expenditure requirements and the growth rate have been assumed to be constant.
Conceivable changes in these assumptions over time are not expected to lead to any indication that the carrying amount for goodwill cannot be defended.

##### Corruption and Bribery

In the global healthcare sector business relationships are established between private and public operators and there is an inherent risk of corruption including improper pay ments made in good faith.
It is therefore important to have clear and detailed guide lines on how business should be conducted.
XVIVO's Code of Conduct and XVIVO's Supplier and Distributor Code of Conduct set out guidelines for avoiding bribes and corrup tion.
In 2024 100 % percent of XVIVO's executive management and Board of Director's acknowledged the Code of Conduct and anti-corrupction policy.
100 % of executive management also received training on anti-corruption.
For all other employee categories training on anti-corruption policy and Code of Conduct is either part of the on boarding process or an annual re-certifica tion process.
All our suppliers are evaluated to ensure they meet our quality standards

potential to reshape liver transplant logistics.
The trial showed that donor livers could be transplanted with good outcomes after up to 20 hours of preservation using DHOPE (Dual Hypothermic Oxegynized Machine Perfusion).
This finding provides transplant clinics with the opportunity for the first time to plan the timing of a transplant and avoid nighttime surgery.
By extending perfusion times UMCG in 2023 was able to perform the majority of all liver transplants during daytime rather than nighttime.

XVIVO acquired FlowHawk a unique communication platform for the transplant process Financial income of SEK 64 million from fair value valuation of financial liabilities

###### Note 25. Financial instruments and financial risk management (cont’d.)

Credit risks The Group's financial assets are recognized at SEK 586 million (685) of which SEK 416 million (546) is cash and cash equivalents.
Historically the Group has had low credit losses and this was also true for 2024.
Risk is limited through the use of credit assessments and advance payments from new customers as well as through close customer monitoring by the finance and marketing functions conjunctively.
Furthermore individual testing is performed of accounts receivable in terms of solvency and credit rating on the balance sheet date.

Currency risks Currency risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of financial instruments due to exchange rate fluctuations.
This risk is related to changes in expected and contracted payment flows (transac tion exposure) the revaluation of foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities in foreign currencies (translation exposure) and financial exposure in the form of currency risks in payment flows for loans and investments.
The company is impacted by variations in exchange rates.
The aim is to minimize the impact of these changes wherever practically possible.

Changes in EUR and USD have the greatest impact.
External sales from the US subsidiary are entirely in USD.
Inflows are matched with the subsidiary's outflows in the form of costs which are also primarily in USD.
External sales from the Dutch subsidiary are entirely in EUR.
Inflows are matched with the subsidiary's outflows in the form of costs which are also primarily in EUR.
External sales from the Swedish Parent Company during 2024 was primarily in EUR 74 percent (72).
Most of the costs for the Swedish units are in SEK but there are some costs in EUR.
These outflows are matched as far as possible with inflows in EUR.
In the other subsidiaries intra-Group revenues in local currency are matched with costs which are essentially in the same local currency.

Sensitivity analysis In order to manage interest and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Group's results.
However in the long term lasting changes in exchange rates and interest rates will have an impact on the consoli dated results.

It has been calculated that a general increase of 5 percent in SEK against all other foreign currencies reduced the Group's operating income before tax by approximately SEK 14 million (8) for the year that ended on December 31 2024.

######## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and concerning the consoli dated accounts in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU.
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern.
They disclose as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.
The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intend to liquidate the company to cease opera tions or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Audit Committee shall without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general among other things oversee the compa ny's financial reporting process.

Auditor's responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consoli dated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consoli dated accounts.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs we exercise professional judgment and maintain profes sional scepticism throughout the audit.
We also

- • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.

- • Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Managing Director’s, use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consoli- dated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern.

- • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- • Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.

We must inform the Board of Directors of among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit.
We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified.

We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable measures that have been taken to eliminate the threats or related safeguards.

########### Basis for Opinions

We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section.
We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.

####### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of and in forming our opinion thereon the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

For the abdominal (liver and kidney) technolo gies Dr Arjan van der Plaats XVIVO's R&D Director Global Engineering & Technical Product Management in collaboration with University Medical Center Groningen carried out the fundamental development.
The deve l op ment work in abdominal has been ongoing since 1999 and is focused on the implementa tion of oxygenated machine perfusion and generating clinical data that supports the innovative technology and methods used.

XVIVO\'s research is mainly done in collabora tion with world leading institutions and researchers.
The technology attracts major interest from external clinics and researchers who initiate pre-clinical and clinical research.

By conducting different research projects alongside partners in the US Canada Australia New Zealand and Europe we ensure our competence and remain at the forefront of clinical development.

In house product development Product development is multidisciplinary and based on collaboration between our special ists in mechanics biochemistry electronics and software development.
The lead times for development and assessment in pre-clinical and clinical trials are long.
Apart from being competent and creative this means that we also need to be persistent and goal oriented.

Product development mainly takes place in house at our head office in Gothenburg (perfusion solutions) at the subsidiaries in Lund (heart) in Denver (lung) and Groningen (kidney and liver).
As a result of sound knowl edge of product development and manufac turing and the relevant regulatory demands we are able to streamline the process and shorten the time to launch.

Clinical evidence In order to document the safety and efficacy of our products we conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials in collaboration with leading researchers and clinics.
Clinical data is the foundation for obtaining market approval for the products but is also critical for demon strating their value to our target groups.

Demanding processes for product approval

To introduce products on different markets regulatory approvals are necessary.
The regulatory demands have become more stringent and the approvals processes more complex.
We emphasize coordination between the various parts of the organization research & development clinical trials and quality & regulatory affairs.
The approvals processes vary not just depending on prod uct but also which market and associated authorities and regulatory framework affected.
The focus is increasing on patient safety but also on clinical evidence ie
proof of the products’ efficacy and safety.
Once a machine or a solution has been approved and intro duced on a market follow up including documentation and reporting to the relevant authorities continues.

The collaboration with Professor Stig Steen has been ongoing since 1998 and research is carried out at Igelosa Life Science

####### Description of key audit matter

As of 31 December 2024 the Group reported goodwill of SEK 682,5 million and capitalized development costs of SEK 676,1 million represent ing 57 % of total assets.
Goodwill will be subject to at least one so called impairment test which contains both complexity and significant elements of assessments from the management of the Group.
An impairment test must be prepared for each of the cash generating units where goodwill and balanced expenses for development work are reported.

Goodwill relates to the operations within perfadex sales as well as the acquisitions of XVIVO B.V XVIVO Services Inc XVIVO Srl and the acquisi tion of FlowHawk which was made through the newly established subsidiary XVIVO Digital Services.
Capitalized expenditures for develop ment work mainly refers to the operations within heart transplantation regulatory approval for XPS and STEEN Solution in the US market as well as acquired assets relating to the kidney and liver areas identified in connection with the acquisition of XVIVO BV.

In the Parent Company shares in subsidiaries are reported at an amount of SEK 495 million whose value is largely affected by the assessment of goodwill and capitalized expenses for develop ment work carried out in the Group.

The test should be carried out according to the applicable regulations according to a certain technique where management must make uture assessments of the company's internal and external conditions and plans.
Examples of such assessments are future payments which requires assumptions about future market conditions and thus indirectly about how competitors can be expected to act. Another important assumption is which discount rate should be used to take into account that future assessed payments are associated with risk and are therefore are worth less than liquid funds that are directly available to the Group.

##### Drivers that affect demand

Transplantation offers lower alternative cost Kidney transplants have been shown to generate significant cost savings for health care providers.
A Swedish study2 showed that if a patient receives a transplant instead for attending dialysis for 10 years this generates savings of between 66-79 percent per patient for healthcare services.
This change should also impact positively on patient quality of life as dialysis can impact a patient's day to day life.

A growing and aging population The global population continues to grow at the same time as the average life span and the proportion of elderly people is rising.
An increased proportion of elderly people in the population is an important factor affecting supply and demand for organ transplantation.
An increasing number of elderly people donate and receive donated organs age is no longer a contraindication.

More people suffer from chronic disease An increasing number of people are affected by chronic disease (or non communicable diseases NCD) mainly due to smoking unhealthy diet insufficient physical activity and dangerous alcohol use.
Chronic disease is the main underlying cause of organ failure which leads to increased demand for transplants.
