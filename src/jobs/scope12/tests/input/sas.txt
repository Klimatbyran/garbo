CO2 emissions per available seat kilometer - Scope 1

In order to calculate the CO 2 emissions for each available seat, the assumption is that each seat is occupied by one passenger which corresponds to 100 kg. The metric is calculated by dividing the total CO 2 emissions with the total available tonne kilometer and then multiplied with 0.1 (i.e. 100 kg or 0.1 tonne).

What are our relative and absolute emissions?

Absolute emissions pertain to the total quantity of emissions, typically measured in tonnes of CO 2 .

Relative emissions denote emissions per production unit, such as grams of CO 2 per tonne-kilometer, grams of CO2 per passenger-kilometer, grams of CO 2 per cargo tonne-kilometer, or grams of CO 2 per available seat-kilometer.

Share of CO2 emissions

In our analysis of total CO 2 emissions for FY 2024, we made the following observations: Flights under 500 km accounted for 11.1% of emissions, flights spanning 500 to 800 km for 10.2%, those between 800 and 3,000 km for 36.6%, and flights exceeding 3,000 km for 42.1%. Domestic flights contributed to 15.1% of emissions, while international flights were responsible for the remainder.

Own business travel

We have direct control over our business trips on SAS flights, resulting in an emission of approximately 10.879 tonnes of CO2 during the year. SAS is currently exploring and assessing strategies to encourage our suppliers to report on our scope 3 emissions.

Non-CO2 emissions

SAS has opted to report different emissions separately in this report, with our emission calculator available on our website. Most emission calculators estimate CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e) using various multipliers to account for non-CO2 emissions. Due to a lack of consensus among scientists and experts on how to convert NOX, particles, and water vapor emissions into CO 2 e, SAS refrains from calculations of CO 2 e. We actively support various initiatives to reduce the impact of non-CO 2 emissions in our daily operations and to develop a more advanced calculation methodology. Our current fleet renewal and technology choices contribute to a greater relative reduction of non-CO 2 emissions compared to CO 2 emissions.

New EU regulation set for enforcement by 2025 will mandate airlines to track and report their non-CO 2 emissions. However, the precise methodology for implementing this reporting requirement is still under consideration, marking an ongoing area of development within the industry.

Contrails, which reflect radiation, exhibit dual effects on the climate - cooling during the day but potentially warming it at night. In FY 2023, IATA established a task force to address non-carbon dioxide (CO 2 )

emissions, with a specific focus on the environmental impact of contrails generated by aircraft. This highlights the imperative for a proactive approach.

In response to the challenges posed by contrails, some companies utilize digital modeling technologies to track moist air patches, offering alternative routes to avoid the formation of contrails.

OUR MOST MATERIAL ISSUES
Reduce climate impact

Based on the materiality assessment conducted in FY 2022, and excluding matters related to accident and safety management, our foremost environmental priority is to reduce our climate impact. With emissions stemming from aircraft operations (Scope 1) accountable for over 99% of our greenhouse gas emissions within scope 1 and 2 this remains a core priority in our sustainability efforts.

To reduce our climate impact, we:

-  Continue fleet modernization
-  Expanding the use of SAF (sustainable aviation fuels)
-  Enhancing flight efficiency
-  Minimizing onboard weight
-  Work together with Air traffic control
-  Find disruptive technologies that are or will be used to reduce CO2 emissions in aviation.

CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer and cargo tonne kilometer - Scope 1

SAS has chosen to apply a calculation method to divide the amount of fuel used for passenger and cargo transport before dividing the amount by passenger or cargo tonne-kilometer. The method is based on the

IATA Carbon Calculator Tool. The assumption is that fuel usage is proportional to weight. Passenger fuel usage is the ratio of total passenger weight to total weight multiplied by the total fuel used. The remainder is allocated to cargo transport.

| Total Passenger FuelUsage   | =   | (Total Passenger Weight/Total Weight) × Total FuelUsed   |
|-----------------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Where, Total Weight         | =   | TotalPassengerWeight + Total Freight/Cargo Weight        |
| Total Passenger Weight (kg) | =   | (Number of Seats ×50kg) + (Number of Passengers ×100 kg) |

The calculation method allocates 50 kg per seat as a prerequisite for passenger transport and the same weight per passenger as used in all other calculations applied within the industry.

For cases when flights were conducted without passengers or freight/cargo transport, all CO 2 emissions were allocated as passenger transport. This may include training flights, positioning flights between scheduled flights, and flights to/from maintenance, etc. The reason for this changed calculation method is to achieve more precise CO 2 emissions per production unit calculations. The previous calculation method essentially involved double accounting, with emissions per passenger kilometer including the fuel used for freight/cargo transport and vice versa.

2025

-  25% lower total CO2 emissions compared with 2005 (absolute emissions)

To reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to advance our environmental efforts, we have established comprehensive and ambitious short- and long-term environmental goals.

In FY 2024, SAS external environment-related user charges and travel taxes amounted to MSEK 2,478 (2,097). These charges and travel taxes comprise environment-related travel taxes and user charges sometimes associated with the environmental performance of aircraft and are included in landing fees. Our environmental taxes in Sweden and Norway amounted to MSEK 981 (961).

In accordance with the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), the aviation industry addresses its CO 2 emissions within the EU through a market-based approach. From January 1, 2021, SAS has also been reporting CO 2 emissions to CORSIA. Furthermore, the United Kingdom introduced its own emission trading scheme (UK-ETS) as of the same date, which SAS fully adheres to.

We advocate for market-based measures that prioritize emission reduction targets and encourage continuous improvement without distorting competition. For several years, SAS has actively supported the development of a global, market-based solution for airline emissions. While SAS fully embraces the Polluter Pays Principle and

takes responsibility for its emissions, we raise concerns about the additional Swedish and Norwegian taxes, which do not directly correlate with actual CO 2 emissions and are in addition to EU-ETS and the soon-to-beintroduced CORSIA. This approach may be viewed as an economic measure but lacks incentives for reducing CO 2 emissions. For instance, a passenger on an A320neo aircraft powered by 50% SAF incurs the same tax as a passenger on an aircraft two generations older, despite the significantly lower emissions of the former.

Environmental related charges -

are charges imposed by the airport operators to motivate aircraft operators to operate aircraft with high eco-  efficiency with respect to noise and other emissions such as NOx, as well as surcharges imposed by airport operators to motivate aircraft operators to avoid take-offs and landings at night.

EMISSION RIGHTS

Any emission rights received from the respective countries' government agencies, without the need for payment of any consideration, are recognized at their nominal amounts, which in practice means that the intangible asset and the prepaid income are valued at zero. Any emission rights purchased for own uses are recognized as intangible assets under current assets at cost after impairment. A provision is recognized in the balance sheet commensurate to the extent that emission rights used correspond to emission rights held. This provision is measured at the cost of the emission rights held. The provision is measured at the current market price with a corresponding cost in the statement of income commensurate to the extent emission rights used exceed the amount of emission rights held.

Emissions calculations and CO2 offsetting

In FY2024, SAS has taken bold steps to reshape the aviation industry by shifting its focus from compensatory measures to long-term emissions reduction. As part of the EuroBonus Conscious Traveler program, SAS discontinued carbon offsetting for EuroBonus travelers, Youth travel with SAS, and staff tickets as of December 1, 2023. This shift redirects efforts toward scaling up the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and advancing new technologies for cleaner flying from the outset. Through the Conscious Traveler program, SAS reinvests in rewarding all participating travelers who contribute to more sustainable travel.

Airlines are required to submit reports annually on the

Material issues to include in reporting
ENVIRONMENT

- Pollution prevention
- Climate change adaption
- Noise pollution

Environmentally related taxes

- Taxes that, in contrast to other corporate taxation, are motivated by environmental grounds. Examples are the environmentally motivated passenger charge in the UK and the environmentally related fiscal CO 2 charges in Sweden and Norway.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

SAS continuously works to reduce energy consumption. The decrease in energy consumption from our base year 2010 is largely attributed to the implementation of more efficient lighting and the reduced utilization of building floor space.

CO 2 emissions

During the year, CO 2 emissions increased three percent year-onyear. The main cause of this was SAS' ramp-up of new destinations and routes. Continuous deliveries of more efficient aircraft, with 15-30% lower fuel consumption than the aircraft they replace, had a positive effect on CO 2 emissions.

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION

<!-- image -->

In FY 2024, the absolute CO 2 emissions from aircraft operations increased by 3% compared to the previous year. This change can be attributed to the higher proportion of international flights, which involve longer travel distances.

Conversely, the CO 2 emissions per passenger kilo  meter decreased by 8% to 81 grams (from 88) driven by a higher cabin factor and the ongoing fleet renewal. The carbon emissions per available seat kilometer experienced a decrease of 5% to 52 grams (from 55).

Throughout FY 2024, SAS utilized 11,455 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking an 89% increase compared to previous year (6,049 tonnes). This growth is driven by customer participation through the purchase of SAF products, as well as compliance with the Norwegian blend-in obligation and Swedish reduction mandate.

Compared to 2005, carbon emissions have significantly decreased by 29% while the production measured in tonne-kilometers has increased (+0.4%). This achievement reflects efficiency improvements in our fleet as well as improved fuel efficiency, among other contributing factors.

SUSTAINABILITY DEFINITIONS
Average number of employees - is

defined as the average number of employees expressed in full-time equivalents, excluding leave of absence, parental leave and long-term sick leave. This definition is also used in financial reporting. Sometimes the term FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is used.

Biofuels - are solid or liquid fuels of biological origin. Liquid fuels for vehicle/ship/aircraft engines. They are considered carbon neutral to various degrees. The EU renewables directive (2009/28/EC) and biofuels directive (2003/30/EC) define the EU's mandates on biofuels and degree of carbon neutrality.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) - is a colorless gas that is formed in the combustion of all fossil fuels.

Cargo tonne kilometer - includes all freight and mail (in metric tonnes) multiplied by the great circle distance flown for all flights performed.

- CDP - is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts. Read more at http:// www.cdp.net.

CFCs - are a group of chlorofluorocarbons that may also contain hydrogen and/or bromide. A class of stable chemical compounds mostly known under the trade names Freon or Halon. Their manufacture is prohibited by the Montreal Protocol because of their depletion of the ozone layer. Aviation has an exception for use under a critical use clause due to the lack of approved alternatives. Research for alternatives is ongoing.

Charges for infrastructure - imposed by the operators of the infrastructure and which are intended to cover operating and capital costs for airlines and air traffic management.

- CO2 - Carbon dioxide (see definition).

CO2 passenger or cargo share - is the amount of CO 2 emissions from passenger or cargo transport.

Code of Conduct - is the ethics rules and guidelines of a particular business.

CSR

- Corporate Social Responsibility.

- dB - Decibel, a logarithmic unit of measurement that expresses the magnitude of a physical quantity relative to a specified or implied reference level.

ASK, Available Seat Kilometers

- -The total number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of kilometers which they are flown.

Capital employed T otal capital according to the balance sheet less non-interest-bearing liabilities.

Carbon dioxide (CO ² ) -A colorless gas that is formed in the combustion of all fossil fuels. The airline industry's CO 2 emissions are being reduced based on a changeover to more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Code share When one or more airlines' flight number is stated in the timetable for a flight, while only one of the airlines operates the flight.

Debt/equity ratio Financial net debt in relation to equity.

EBIT -

Operating income.

EBIT margin EBIT divided by revenue.

- EBT Income before tax.
- EEA European Economic Area.

Equity method Shares in affiliated companies are taken up at the SAS Group's share of equity, taking acquired surplus and deficit values into account.

Equity/assets ratio Equity in relation to total assets.

Financial net debt Interest-bearing liabilities less interest-bearing assets excluding net pension funds.

Financial net debt/Adjusted EBITDA Average financial net debt in relation to Adjusted EBITDA.

Financial preparedness Cash and cash equivalents, plus unutilized credit facilities with a maturity longer than three months, in relation to fixed costs

FTE Average number of employees, full-time equivalents.

IATA International Air Transport Association. A global association of almost 300 airlines.

ICAO International Civil Aviation Organization. The United Nations' specialized agency for international civil aviation.

Interest-coverage ratio Operating income plus financial income in relation to financial expenses.

Interline revenue Ticket settlement between airlines.

Items affecting comparability Items affecting comparability are identified to facilitate comparison of SAS' underlying results in different periods. These items consist of impairment, restructuring costs, capital gains/losses, and other items affecting comparability. They arise as a consequence of specific events, and are items that both management and external assessors take note of when analyzing SAS. By reporting earnings excluding nonrecurring items, the underlying results are shown, which facilitates comparability between different periods.

LCC Low Cost Carrier. Low Cost Carrier.

Load factor RPK divided by ASK. Describes the capacity utilization of available seats.

- NPV Net present value. Used to calculate capitalized future costs of operating leases for aircraft, for example.

Operating leases Based on a leasing contract in which the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor and is equivalent to renting. The leasing charges are expensed on a current basis in the statement of income. As of November 1, 2019, SAS Group applies IFRS 16 Leases. See Right-of-use assets.
