### Metrics and targets

Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Scandic has set a clear goal to reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions by 50 percent per square meter (CO2e/m²) by 2030 compared with the base year 2019.
This means that emis sions per square meter must be decreased from 13.02 kg CO2e/m² in 2019 to 6.51 kg CO2e/m² by 2030.
During 2024 Scandic reduced emissions by 30 percent compared with 2019.

The decrease can be partly explained by the increased use of renewable electricity and district heating compared with the base year 2019.
Together with reduced energy and water consumption this has led to lower carbon emissions.
See the table below.
For more information on gross greenhouse gas emissions within scope 1 2 and 3 as well as total greenhouse gas emissions see page 49.

To achieve this goal Scandic has clear action plans that primarily focus on energy efficiency and using green energy such as fossil free district heating and renewable electricity. Increasing awareness and changing behavior among team members guests partners and property owners can help Scandic reduce emissions further. As part of the effort to reduce climate emissions Scandic also analyzes all indirect emissions in the value chain and has identified necessary measures to operate with the least environmental impact possible. Emissions and energy
| When it comes to emissions from the gas oil refrigerants heating cooling and electricity that Scandic uses the road to fossil free operations is mainly dependent on the efforts of district heating companies to reduce their use of fossil energy sources. This is because emissions from | district heating account for the majority of Scandic's CO2 emissions in Scope 1 and 2. To reduce energy consumption Scandic is working to optimize operations and implement energy saving measures such as LED lighting and motion control solutions as well as energy efficient kitchen installations and equipment. Energy consumption per square meter decreased by 3.9 percent between 2024 and the comparison year 2019 which can partly be explained by reduced water consumption improved energy efficiency and monitoring. This together with a larger amount of fossil free district heating and an increased share of renewable electricity has led to reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to the base year 2019 Scandic's carbon dioxide emissions per square meter were reduced by 30 percent. For more information about Scandic's environmental and climate efforts see page 47.

## Governance

The role of administrative management and supervisory bodies as well as the information and sustainability issues submitted to and addressed by these bodies

Follow up of the most significant sustainability matters is vhandled by the Executive Committee.
The SISC prepares sustain ability matters and provides recommendations to the Executive Committee which in turn provides recommendations to the Board.
In 2024 the Board and Executive Committee addressed the following sustainability related issues

⦁ Review and assurance of the implementation of the prioritized actions and goals for 2024.

⦁ Decision on prioritized areas and goals for 2025.

⦁ Updating and approving most of Scandic's policies.
When external expertise is needed Scandic collaborates with relevant stakeholders to ensure knowledge and expertise on sustainability matters.
The Board and Executive Committee have conducted CSRD training.

Sustainability management Scandic's sustainability initiatives are based on the sustainability matters that are most material to its business in terms of its impacts risks and opportunities.
To ensure that sustainability matters are anchored and integrated across the entire company Scandic has a cross functional Sustainability Initiative Steering Committee (SISC).
The SISC recommends prioritized actions goal setting and a budget for each year which are approved by the Board and Executive Committee.
In addition the SISC also ensures the overall progress of Scandic's sustainability initiatives.
Scandic's strategy and sustainability department prepares SISC meetings and supports sustainability initiatives across the entire organiza tion.
Responsibility for executing sustainability initiatives is dele gated to the respective functions within the organization and the effectiveness of governance is continuously evaluated through performance monitoring.
The Executive Committee the Audit Committee and the Board receive regular updates on key sustain ability matters and achievement of goals.

For more information see pages 84-87.

Calculations of carbon dioxide emissions within scope 1 2 and 3 are handled by Scandic's central procurement department and strategy and sustainability department.
All environmental data has been verified through a third party review by Ethos International in accordance with AA1000AS v3.


<!-- PAGE: 34 -->

##### Sustainable Procurement Guidelines

Scandic's Sustainable Procurement Guidelines are the theoretical framework that underpins all decisions regarding sustainable procurement within the company.
The guidelines also provide detailed information on production conditions with specific requirements for energy efficient production and low carbon emissions.
For more information on sustainable procurement see page 53.

Actions in relation to climate change mitigation and energy Scandic is actively working according to a transition plan focused on energy efficiency and the shift to green renewable energy.
During 2024 the company focused on the following actions Scope 1 and 2 ⦁ Compliance with sustainability requirements of the Nordic Swan Ecolabel Scandic has ensured that its operations comply with the Nordic Swan Ecolabel's requirements for sustainable hotel operations including targets for energy efficiency and sustainable procurement.

⦁ Increased purchases of fossil free district heating and renewable electricity To reduce emissions within scope 1 and 2 a larger share of the company's energy consumption was shifted to renewable energy sources.

⦁ Development of a new 5 year plan for energy efficiency A sustainability fund was established to finance energy effi ciency measures.
At the same time property management and work routines related to energy consumption are being strength ened.
During 2025 the company will evaluate two different energy management models to identify the most effective strategy for optimizing energy use at its hotels.

⦁ Overview of climate targets Scandic has begun work to revise scope 1 and 2 targets in line with the latest climate science.

##### Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct includes a commitment to minimizing environmental impact continuously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing energy consumption.
For more information see page 55.

Scandic has an established goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (measured in CO₂ equivalents) by 50 percent per square meter of space by 2030 compared with 2019.
This target includes emissions in Scopes 1 and 2.
In 2024 Scandic achieved a 30 percent reduction in CO₂ emissions per square meter of space compared to 2019.

To achieve this goal Scandic follows a clear transition plan focused on mitigating climate change through energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy including fossil free district heating and renewable electricity.
Energy efficiency contributes to reduced resource consumption and cost savings.
Scandic systemat ically works through an environmental management system where the criteria for Nordic Swan Ecolabel certification set limits for energy and water usage as well as requirements for sustainable procurement for all hotels.
This holistic approach strengthens Scandic's competitiveness while also reducing its climate impact.

Material impacts risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

Mitigation of climate change and energy Scandic's hotel operations and value chain have a climate impact.
To minimize this impact Scandic actively follows a transition plan that includes measures for energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy.

######## Board and Executive Committee

Ultimately Scandic's Board is responsible for its sustainability strategy.
The Board's Audit Committee is further responsible for reviewing and ensuring in accordance with its instructions that there is sufficient and satisfactory internal control of sustainability reporting.

Reporting errors in prior periods In 2024 Scandic made minor adjustments to its carbon emissions calculation methodology.
In accordance with the GHG Protocol emissions from franchisees are now reported under Scope 3 instead of Scope 1 and 2 as previously.
Energy data has also been updated to now exclude franchisees.
To ensure comparability historical data has also been adjusted to reflect this change.

In conducting the double materiality analysis which forms the basis for the sustainability reporting Scandic's upstream and downstream value chain was considered.

Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances

Value chain estimation and sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty Emissions data is calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol based on consumption data and supplier sta tistics.
Scandic currently only reports parts of scope 3 but is con stantly working to improve the quality of its carbon calculations.
This work includes increased use of primary data such as weight based data as well as an expansion of the categories reported within scope 3.
The aim is to enhance the accuracy of Scandic's published emissions statistics and more effectively measure the impact of the implemented emission reduction measures.

### Strategy

Transition plan for climate change mitigation Climate change poses potential risks for Scandic's operations including increased energy costs carbon taxes new regulatory requirements water restrictions changing customer behaviors and supply chain disruptions.

Within Scandic's transition plan targets for indirect carbon emissions (Scope 3) are also being established in line with the Paris Agreement and with the approval of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Scandic typically leases hotel properties through long term lease agreements.
If a property has poor energy efficiency or a sub optimal electricity supply this can result in “locked-in” emissions throughout the entire lease period.
As a hotel operator Scandic has limited opportunities to influence a property's fundamental construction and technical systems which creates challenges in efforts to reduce climate impact.
To manage this challenge Scandic creates shared incentives and strives to establish a competitive sustainable and responsible collaboration with property owners.
Scandic's transition plan to limit climate change is an integral part of its sustainability strategy.
The plan is updated regularly in collaboration with relevant parts of Scandic's operations and the SISC and it is established through approval by both the Executive Committee and the Board.

Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Scandic's Code of Conduct Environmental Policy Supplier Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Sustainable Procurement together serve as guiding policies to reduce the company's negative environmental impact.

Energy usage per square meter decreased by 3.9 percent between 2024 and the base year 2019 which can be partly explained by reduced water consumption better energy efficiency and improved monitoring.
Scandic increased the share of renewable energy from 53.7 percent in 2019 to 54.3 percent in 2024.

Changes in preparation or presentation of sustainability information In 2024 Scandic began adapting to ESRS in preparation for reporting the 2025 financial year aligning with the expanded requirements introduced by the implementation of CSRD and its associated reporting standards in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Previous reporting under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards contains similar information and is therefore excluded from this year's report.
Consequently certain information is presented using different metrics adapted to ESRS.

The sustainability report has been prepared at a consolidated level and the scope is the same as for Scandic's financial report ing.
In addition certain reporting from Scandic's franchisees is also included (data on water chemicals and waste as well as statistics for Nordic Swan Ecolabel certification).

At the same time increased demand for sustainable solutions may lead to higher procurement costs as guests and partners place greater demands related to environ mental issues.

Financial opportunities include increased customer satisfaction and a stronger brand position due to Scandic's work to mitigate climate change.
Moreover investments in energy efficiency can contribute to long term reductions in operating costs and improved profitability.

|  | Ambition | According to ISO 14024 the Nordic Swan Ecolabel is a Type 1 ecolabel and one of the world's most credible environmental certifications. It ensures that a product meets all of the environmental requirements of an independent third party the Nordic Ecolabelling Board. Requirements are continually sharpened and developed from a life cycle perspective. These requirements help Scan dic in its work to reduce its use of resources. The chart below illustrates how Scandic has reduced its environmental impact per guest night through constant improvements in hotel operations. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scandic's ambition is to be a leader in sustain | able hotel operations by constantly minimizing | its environmental and climate impact.
| Activities and initiatives Nordic Swan Ecolabel for constant improvement |
| Scandic aims for all hotels to be certified by the Nordic Swan Ecolabel or at a minimum comply with the limit values for energy consumption unsorted waste water consumption and ecola beled chemicals for cleaning internal laundry and washing dishes. All team members at Scandic's hotels also undergo training on the criteria of the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. |
| SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT GOVERNANcE ANd AdMINISTRATION FINANcIAL REPORTS | At year end 96 percent of Scandic's hotels were certified. During the year Scandic focused on ensuring that its hotels in Germany and Poland met with the strict environmental requirements which makes Scandic the first hotel company in these countries with hotels certified by the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. |

Given this it could be argued that the majority of Scandic's hotel portfolio is not included in the economic activity as Scandic's hotels do not have the opportunity to contribute to the environ mental goal according to the established criteria.
However accord ing to the FAQs published in draft form by the European Commis sion in November 2024 it was clarified that hotels included in activity 2.1 can be tested for taxonomy alignment regardless of their location.
Based on this clarification it was assessed that all of Scandic's hotels should still be covered by the economic activity and considered eligible but that the majority are exempt from the investigation of technical screening criteria 1 and 2 regarding com pliance with the taxonomy's environmental goals.
For the majority of Scandic's hotel portfolio the testing of taxonomy alignment was therefore conducted based on substantial contribution solely according to technical screening criteria 3-5 as well as all techni cal screening criteria to ensure no significant harm to other environmental goals.

| Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts risks and opportunities The double materiality analysis was conducted in accordance with ESRS with the support of external advisors with special expertise in the area. The analysis which was reviewed and approved by Scandic's Executive Committee and Board was carried out in four phases
| 1. Context analysis and identification of possible sustainability areas for impacts risks and opportunities.
| 2. Stakeholder dialogues conducted through surveys and interviews.
| GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FINANCIAL REPORTS
| 3. Evaluation of impacts risks and opportunities
| 4. Execution and validation.
| Context analysis and identification of sustainability impacts risks and opportunities Scandic identified potentially material sustainability matters based on previous materiality analyses market and industry reports societal sustainability trends and an overview of relevant legislation and sector specific frameworks as well as the ESRS. The criteria for Nordic Swan Ecolabel certification which maps hotel operations’ impacts risks and opportunities were also used to identify relevant sustainability matters. These sustainability matters were validated with key personnel and external experts before being included in the continued analysis.
| Stakeholder engagement To gain a deeper understanding of key sustainability matters for Scandic surveys and interviews were conducted. Two types of sur veys were used a shorter version for guests and a more compre hensive survey for other stakeholders. A total of 11 interviews were conducted to identify key sustainability matters assess risks and opportunities and evaluate current practices and communication. The stakeholder groups were selected by Scandic based on their impact on the company. They included guests team members the Executive Committee suppliers property owners corporate clients analysts and owners.
| Evaluation of impacts risks and opportunities The third phase of the analysis included a workshop with the SISC and other key personnel from Scandic. The purpose of the work shop was to evaluate and assess Scandic's sustainability impact as well as the financial effects of risks and opportunities. The assess ment of impacts financial risks and opportunities was based on severity scope and likelihood. For negative impacts the extent to which damage could be remedied was taken into consideration.
| Probability was assessed on a five point scale where actual or highly likely effects were rated as "5 = very likely." In assessing the severity and financial impact gross risk was used meaning an evaluation without considering the actions already taken.
| To determine material sustainability matters the median scores of all evaluated sustainability matters were set as a threshold value. Generally sustainability matters above the median were considered material with two exceptions. The matters “Workers in the value chain Working conditions workers’ rights and equal treatment” and “Affected communities (human trafficking)” fell below the threshold but were still included due to their potential negative impact on human rights and the significance of individual cases for Scandic.
| Execution and validation External advisors conducted a final validation of the results. A final validation workshop was then held with SISC. The double material ity analysis was approved by the Board and Executive Committee.
| Learning and development are of significant strategic importance for Scandic both to be well equipped to meet the needs of guests and to attract and retain team members.

| TAXONOMY REPORT
| Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation)
| Background
| In order to achieve the EU's climate goals and to make it easier to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities the EU has introduced what is known as the EU taxonomy. The taxonomy is an EU wide classification system that aims to increase invest ments in sustainable activities within the EU. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a key component of the European Commission's action plan to redirect capital flows toward a more sustainable economy and an important step toward achieving carbon neutral ity before 2050 in line with the EU's climate goals.
| 1 and 2 (Annex 1 and 2) related to applicable economic activities. For this reason Scandic's applicable turnover for these years amounted to 0. In June 2023 however the list of applicable activities was expanded. The delegated acts of the EU Taxonomy Regulation along with additional annexes for environmental objectives 3-6. Environmental objective 6 Biodiversity includes activity “2 Accommodation activities” and more specifically “2.1 Hotels holiday camping grounds and similar accommodation” in which Scandic's turnover is included. reporting the original assessment of how the taxonomy works included the requirement that the business must meet all five technical screening criteria for contributing substantially to the specific economic activity. For activity 2.1 technical screening criteria 1 and 2 focus solely on criteria that can be met by hotels located in or near protected areas.
| In 2024 Scandic therefore investigated whether its hotels are located in or near any protected areas. Based on the Natura 2000 tools and the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter Scandic identified that only five hotels less than 2 percent of Scandic's total portfolio are located near such risk areas.
| GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FINANCIAL REPORTS
| Accounting principles
| Scandic has been covered by the EU directive from the financial year 2021 since the company is classified as a large group accord ing to the taxonomy has shares listed on a regulated market and has more than 500 employees on average. The above category has been assessed to cover Scandic's entire net turnover except for franchise and management fees as this revenue stream is currently not included in the taxonomy's list of applicable activities. Apart from franchise and management fees the category includes Scandic's entire revenue such as room reve nue conference revenue and revenue from the sale of food and beverages at hotels. Scandic's policy is that the assessment of CapEx and OpEx follows the same evaluation as turnover as the investments are made to support the activities that generate turnover.
| In order for a hotel to be assessed as environmentally sustain able or aligned with the environmental goals set by the taxonomy and to be considered an applicable activity in the taxonomy In 2022 Scandic's turnover was not included in the delegated acts of the EU Taxonomy Regulation environmental objectives
| Less than 2 percent of Scandic's total portfolio is located in or near a protected area.
| Economic activities that are taxonomy eligible
| Turnover | 21,927 | 99.9 (100.0) | 0.1 (0.0) | Under investigation | Under investigation
| CapEx | 3,606 | 100.0 (100.0) | 0.0 (0.0) | Under investigation | Under investigation
| OpEx | 266 | 100.0 (100.0) | 0.0 (0.0) | Under investigation | Under investigation

- 1) For 2024, Scandic has reported its activities as applicable but not fully aligned, as the interpretation of how the regulations should be applied and assessed for compliance has been discussed with the EU Commission. FAQs from the Commission on this matter were published in late 2024, and then only in draft form. When the European Commission’s interpretations are finalized in 2025, Scandic’s assessments of the level of compliance may therefore change.

## Strategy

Interests and views of stakeholders GOVERNANcE ANd AdMINISTRATION FINANcIAL REPORTS

Scandic maintains an ongoing dialogue with suppliers to ensure that their employees’ interests opinions and rights are considered and safeguarded.
For more information on how stakeholders’ interests and feedback are taken into account see page 37.
Scandic is aware of its responsibility throughout the entire value chain and actively works to ensure that suppliers’ labor practices and ethical guidelines align with the company's sustainability requirements and principles.

In its domestic markets Scandic has identified the risk of exploitation of migrant workers among subcontractors in the cleaning and construction sectors.
Outside Scandic's domestic markets the main risks have been assessed to be linked to workers on coffee plantations in Africa Asia and South America as well as workers in the textile production industry in Asia.

Material impacts risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

Working conditions and work related rights Through its procurement Scandic indirectly impacts suppliers’ employees making their working conditions and rights an import ant concern for the company.
Scandic's largest purchasing categories include

The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to suppliers subcontrac tors and other business partners including both permanent and temporary employees within their organizations.
The code is available on Scandic's website and is attached to all procurement documents.

Scandic's Supplier Code of Conduct has been adopted by the Board and is managed by the Chief Financial Officer.
The opera tional responsibility for implementation lies with the director of Group procurement in collaboration with the managing directors in each respective country of operations.

⦁ Food & beverage ⦁ Services ⦁ Materials for renovations and maintenance ⦁ Contracted workers ⦁ Laundry services

Among the professional groups working at Scandic's hotels that are not part of Scandic's staff outsourced cleaning staff and workers within construction and renovations constitute the largest group.

Additionally workers at the beginning of the value chain includ ing those involved in cultivating and processing raw materials such as grains dairy products coffee and proteins may be impacted by Scandic's operations.
Other professional groups significantly impacted by Scandic's operations include workers in the manufac turing of fixed and loose furnishings as well as staff at external laundry suppliers.

Identified risks both within and outside of Scandic's domestic market have been assessed to be systemic and industry specific meaning they are structurally linked to the sectors in which the suppliers operate.
For this reason Scandic is particularly vigilant when making purchases in these sectors and has a reinforced focus on responsible supplier relationships.
However Scandic has not identified any reported cases of negative impact related to these risks.

## Provisions

Provisions for environmental restoration measures restructuring costs and legal claims are reported when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

##### Turnover

According to the taxonomy total turnover is the same as net sales according to the consolidated income statement see page 89.
The Group's net sales consist of the value of goods and services gener ated in hotels under lease agreements as well as management and franchise fees.
Franchise and management fees have been excluded from applicable revenue as this revenue stream is not covered by the taxonomy's applicable economic activities.

Capital expenditures (CapEx) Total CapEx refers to investments in tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill and right of use assets.
Investments during the year can be found in Notes 12 and 13 on pages 105 and 106.
CapEx related to right of use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 for the financial year amounts to approximately 3.6 billion SEK (6.1) and consists mainly of extensions of existing leases and new leases for hotel properties.
These investments can be found in Note 13 on page 106.
Total CapEx for the year amounted to 3.7 billion SEK (6.6).
According to the taxonomy applicable CapEx refers to invest ments related to an identified sales activity (2.1 Hotels holiday camping grounds and similar accommodation).
Since all CapEx was intended to benefit Scandic's economic activities 100 percent of CapEx for the year is considered applicable for the current financial year.

Operating expenses (OpEx) According to the taxonomy total OpEx is considered to be costs for maintaining the Group's fixed assets.
For Scandic these costs include direct expenses related to maintenance of property plant and equipment carried out by the Group or third parties that is necessary to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of the assets including renovation expenses related to property plant and equipment and short term leases.
These costs are not speci fied in the consolidated income statement but are included in Other external costs on page 89.
Eligible OpEx is the part of the total OpEx that relates to identified sales activities (2.1 Hotels holiday camping grounds and similar accommodation) which for 2023 is considered to be 100 percent.

Next steps The next step in Scandic's work related to the taxonomy is to determine and work toward taxonomy alignment for turnover CapEx and OpEx in accordance with the taxonomy's criteria for the biodiversity environmental objective.
When the final guidance based on the FAQs which are currently in draft form is published the Group will consider this in its ongoing work to assess comp liance for the 2025 reporting.

| Targets | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reduce edible food waste by 25% per guest night (compared with base year 2019) by 2025 | -31% | -17%
![table image]({page: 54, x: 266}, {y: 231, {width: 232}, {height: 17})

Beyond the goal to reduce food waste Scandic has still not devel oped additional measurable goals for sustainable resource use or waste management.
Scandic however monitors and applies limit values for recycling and sustainable procurement at all hotels certified by the Nordic Swan Ecolabel.

Resource inflows Scandic currently lacks information on the weight of all purchases.

Resource outflows The total amount of waste decreased by 21 percent in 2024 com pared to 2019.
Scandic collects monthly waste data categorized by waste type including hazardous waste recyclable materials household/residual waste and landfill.

Waste data is gathered through regular weighing by Scandic's waste service providers.
Each month data is sent directly to Scan dic's internal systems for most hotels while hotels with individual suppliers conduct manual reporting.
An exception is in Sweden where municipalities cannot provide Scandic with the actual weight of household waste classified as non hazardous waste.
Instead reporting is based on estimates.
Waste reporting encom passes both Scandic operated hotels and franchise operated hotels.
Food waste is weighed daily and the data is analyzed monthly.

| Waste tonnes | 2024 | 2019 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total amount of waste | 15,701.8 | 19,924.3
| Total weight diverted from disposal |

Material impacts risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

Through the double materiality analysis Scandic has identified sustainability matters where its business directly or through the value chain has a significant impact on people and the environment as well as where risks and opportunities can impact Scandic's financial position.
For information on how material sustainability matters are linked to Scandic's sustainability strategy and integrated into the business model see page 34.

For a description of the materiality analysis process see page 40.
