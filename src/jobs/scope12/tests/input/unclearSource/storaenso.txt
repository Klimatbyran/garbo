Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions (E1-6)

Stora Enso's carbon footprint, following the financial consolidation scope (aligned with ESRS)

Stora Enso's carbon footprint, following the GHG Protocol's principle of operational control
Accounting principles

In its GHG accounting, Stora Enso follows the three standards provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development: the GHG Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Stora Enso uses the operational control approach to consolidate these standards. The science-based targets for reducing GHG emissions are reported as a percentage change from the baseline, which is updated annually to reflect the current Company structure.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions include direct and indirect GHG emissions, calculated as fossil CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 eq), from all production units, excluding joint operations. In addition to CO 2 , other relevant GHG emissions for Stora Enso are methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which are generated when using fossil and biomass fuels in the units' power boilers. These gases are converted to CO 2 eq using their respective global warming potential based on the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), or fuel-specific CO 2 emission factors based on site analysis. The sources of Stora Enso's Scope 1 factors are 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas inventories, Chapter 2: Stationary Combustion, and for biogenic emissions Fuel classification 2018 from Statistics Finland. HFCs are estimated to present 500 to 1,000 tonnes, while SF6 is not applicable.

In 2024, 60% of Stora Enso's Scope 1 emissions were from regulated emission trading schemes. For more information on emissions covered by trading schemes, see Financial Statements, note 4.5 Emission rights and other non-current assets. In 2024, the biogenic emissions related to Scope 1 amounted to 9.14 (million tCO 2 eq). When including joint operations, the biogenic emissions related to Scope 1 were 11.86 (million tCO 2 eq).

Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated based on purchased electricity and heat. The CO 2 emission factors used for purchased energy largely follow the market-based methodology, meaning that almost all units apply CO 2 factors provided by their energy suppliers. When these are not available, the Group applies the country-specific residual mix factor. In the absence of residual mix factors, the most recent location-based factors provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used. The applied factors do not separate the percentage of biogenic CO 2 . Scope 2 includes market instruments, such as the trading of Guarantees of Origin for electricity.

Scope 3 emissions include fossil CO 2 eq emissions from other sources in the upstream and downstream value chain of all production units. Stora Enso follows the WBCSD guidance for Scope 3, which includes 15 potential categories of emissions and applies an activity-based methodology for Scope 3 accounting. This means that emissions are estimated by multiplying the activity data with the relevant carbon emission factors.

Due to estimation based on volume materiality, some categories may be excluded from the reporting if they are deemed insignificant to total emissions, or not applicable to the Group's business operations. Material emission categories included in Scope 3 emissions are reviewed whenever new information on data level or accounting methodology becomes available. When primary data is not available for the carbon emission factors of Stora Enso's activity data, the Group utilises secondary sources, such as EcoInvent, the Network for Transport Measures, Metsäteho, The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment (ACE) and the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO). Occasionally proxy factors are also used.

In the 2024 reporting, the Scope 3 categories, as defined by ESRS, included: Purchased goods and services, Fuel and energy related activities, Upstream transportation and distribution, and Processing of sold products. The share of primary data used based on the volume of emissions is 10%. In GHG accounting, joint operations are included as part of Scope 3 emissions due to the lack of operational control, which is further explained in ESRS 2 BP-1. To ensure ESRS-alignment, an alternative carbon footprint, following the consolidation principles of the Group's Financial Statements, has been disclosed at the start of this section.

The excluded Scope 3 categories are: Capital goods, Waste generated in operations, Business travelling, Employee commuting, Upstream leased assets, Downstream transportation, Use of sold products, End-of-life treatment of sold products, Downstream leased assets, Franchises, and Investments.

'Stora Enso holds leading market positions in renewable packaging, biomaterials, and sustainable construction segments.'

Scope 1 and 2 emissions, originating directly from our operations and the energy we consume, are areas where we can implement emission reductions through investments and fuel switching. Our success in these categories demonstrates our ability to effectively mitigate our direct impact on climate through operational efficiency and the implementation of new technologies. We are also committed to achieving a 50% reduction in our Scope 3 emissions by 2030, which include indirect emissions from activities such as purchased goods and the processing of sold products. Essentially, these emissions represent the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of other companies within our value chain.

As we continue working toward our Scope 3 target, we are actively engaging and partnering with our suppliers and customers. It is essential that the full value chain commits to climate action together. By doing so, we are not only achieving crucial emission reductions for Stora Enso but also paving the way for businesses of the future.

Climate-related impacts

The analysis comprised impacts on climate change through the Group's own operations (Scope 1 and 2) and value chain (Scope 3) emissions as disclosed in ESRS E1-6. Screening was conducted for all production sites and material value chain emission categories. Stora Enso did not utilise other drivers for climate-related impacts in the scenario analysis although the Group recognises the Stockholm Resilience Centre's Planetary Boundaries framework and related tipping points in its sustainability work. In addition to actual impacts, Stora Enso has estimated its potential impacts based on production forecasts. Stora Enso's locked-in GHG emission are described in ESRS E1-1.

Accounting principles

To align with the ESRS requirements, Stora Enso discloses an alternative carbon footprint in the table below. In these figures, joint operations are consolidated line by line into Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions according to the ownership share (50%). This consolidation approach is aligned with the Financial Statements. For further accounting principles on greenhouse gas emissions, see next page.

Stora Enso's total sales as reported in the Financial Statements are used to determine the greenhouse gas emission intensity.

Sustainability progress

During 2024, we continued to make progress on our sustainability targets, achieving reductions in carbon emissions across all three Scope categories. Both active measures to reduce emissions and the closure of sites and production lines contributed to a 53% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 39% decrease in Scope 3 emissions compared to the 2019 baseline.

Our commitment to circularity involves reducing, reusing, and recycling materials in both production and consumption. We integrate circularity into our product development and collaborate with customers and partners to promote product recycling. By the end of 2024, 94% of our products were technically recyclable.

Our biodiversity initiatives aim for a net positive impact, with action programmes in place until 2030 to enhance biodiversity at the species, habitat, and landscape levels. Additionally, the share of forest certification coverage of the land we own or manage remained high at 99%.

GHG removals and storage (E1-7)

Stora Enso's business activities are connected with GHG removals and carbon storage, as the Group's forests sequester carbon and its woodbased products store carbon. While the Group does not use these removals or storage in its greenhouse gas reporting of Scope 1, 2 and 3, the amounts are disclosed in accordance with ESRS requirements to provide a coherent picture of the positive impacts identified as part of the double materiality assessment.

Stora Enso's primary means of reducing fossil carbon emissions is through direct action within its own operations and value chain as described in ESRS E1-3. The Group's carbon performance is reported without offsets as advised by the Science Based Targets initiative. Although direct action is the primary means of emissions reduction, some emissions currently remain unavoidable. Therefore, carbon offsetting is used for certain Group products to offer materials that help customers reduce their climate impact. Offsetting for products is only done through projects that are measurable and third-party verified, such as those in accordance with the Gold Standard.

Emission rights

For 2024, 0.4 million tonnes of free emission allowances in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading Directive were allocated to the company. Emission allowances are recognised through a net cash cost basis, meaning that the difference between the actual emissions and the emission allowances received is recognised through profit or loss if the actual emissions are larger than the emission allowances received. During the financial period, the emissions emitted were estimated at 0.3 million tonnes. The emission rights purchased during the financial period are recognised in other operating expenses, and the emission rights sold during the financial period are recognised in other operating income.

4.5 Emission rights and other non-current assets
Accounting principles

The Group participates in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Group has been allocated allowances to emit a fixed tonnage of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) over a fixed period of time, which are recognised as intangible assets, government grants and as liabilities for the obligation to deliver allowances equal to those emissions that have been made during the compliance period.

Intangible assets related to emission allowances are measured at level 1 fair value at the date of initial recognition. The liabilities to deliver allowances are recognised based on actual emissions and are settled using allowances on hand and measured at the carrying amount of those allowances. At the reporting date, if the market value for the emission allowances is less than the carrying amount, any surplus allowances that are not required to cover emissions made are impaired to the market value.

The Group expenses emissions made at the grant date fair value, under materials and services, together with purchased emission rights at their purchase price. Such costs will be offset under other operating income by the income from the original rights used at their grant date fair value. The consolidated income statement will, thus, be neutral in respect to all the rights consumed that were within the original grant of rights. Sales of excess emission allowances are recognised as income on the delivery date. Any net effect represents the costs of purchasing additional rights to cover excess emissions, or the sale of unused rights in case that the realised emissions are below the allowances received free of charge or the impairment of allowances that are not required for own use.

The following two key actions carried out in the Group's own operations contribute to the achievement of the objectives outlined in the Environmental Guidelines for preventing, mitigating, and remedying impacts to air, water, and soil. Both long-term actions are aligned with the target of achieving zero environmental non-compliances.

Pollution-related impacts and risks are connected to Stora Enso's business model, as the Group's production processes generate emissions to both air and water. This poses a risk of local significant or even critical negative impacts for both the environment and people. During the past years, some of the risks have materialised into local environmental incidents. The actual negative impacts can be caused, for example, by atmospheric emissions and aerosol loading from fuel combustion for energy generation. Negative impacts related to water contamination are mainly caused by water effluents and pollutants containing suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen, and absorbable organic halogen compounds.

To ensure water quality and compliance with local permit limits, Stora Enso's board, pulp, and paper mills continuously monitor effluent discharges, including temperature and pH levels, into local water bodies. Compliance with local environmental permit limits is regulated and controlled by relevant authorities, with any deviations promptly reported to them. Regarding atmospheric emissions, Stora Enso employs advanced technologies such as scrubbers and boiler process control systems to reduce air emissions and mitigate odours from point sources at its industrial units. These emissions primarily stem from fuel combustion for energy generation and from production processes.

- As an example, a new electric boiler was commissioned at the Anjala site in Finland in 2024, not only reducing the use of fossil fuels but also minimising emissions to air.

Pollution of air, water and soil (E2-4)
Accounting principles

According to the European Sustainability Reporting Standard on Pollution, the consolidation of each pollutant includes only the emissions from facilities for which the applicable threshold value specified in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 is exceeded.

The reporting of pollutants is a combination of unit-specific direct measurement, estimates, and calculations of emissions. Aligned with Stora Enso's Financial Statements, the figures contain emissions to air and water generated by the Group's joint operations according to the ownership share (50%).

Water effluents are monitored using both online and offline measurements, such as standard methods for the forest products industry. Board, pulp, and paper production sites monitor process water discharges, and water pollutants such as suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen, and absorbable organic halogen compounds. Monitoring and reporting are conducted daily, monthly, or annually depending on the sites' operations, pollutants, and environmental permits. The share of the measure obtained from direct measurement is estimated to be almost 100%.

Third party assessments are used as a basis for estimates, in particular for heavy metal related emissions when direct measuring equipment is not available. In these cases, the average of third-party measured values is applied for the full year. The data is reported by each mill to Group's environmental reporting system based on direct measurements or estimates based on third party calculations..

Non-compliance incidents related to pollution during 2024 are disclosed as part of ESRS E2-3, including short-term actions regarding corrective and preventive measures.

The pollution of soil is a material topic for Stora Enso due to the environmental provision related to remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations in Falun, Sweden. Within Stora Enso's own organisation, thresholds for pollution of soil are not exceeded, and therefore not disclosed as part of  ESRS E2-4.

General basis for preparation of the Sustainability Statement (BP-1)

Stora Enso's Sustainability Statement has been prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Finnish Accounting Act and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). It follows the same consolidation principles as the Financial Statements prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards. Unless otherwise stated, the Group's consolidated performance figures expressed in this report relate to the parent company, Stora Enso Oyj, and all companies in which the Group holds 50% or more of the voting rights, directly or indirectly. For more information on Group's structure, see Financial Statements, note 6.2 Group structure.

Joint control refers to the contractually agreed sharing of control of a joint arrangement, which exists only when decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all parties sharing control. Joint operations are joint arrangements in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities associated with the arrangement.

Stora Enso has two joint operations, Veracel in Brazil and Montes del Plata in Uruguay. In both companies, Stora Enso holds a 50% ownership. In the Group's Financial Statements, the joint operations are recognised and consolidated based on Stora Enso's share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows of the joint operation.

In its current adopted form, ESRS lacks guidance on the consolidation principle for joint operations. Regarding its joint operations, Stora Enso does not have full authority to introduce and implement operating policies, practices, and targets, rendering most of the ESRS reporting requirements invalid. The same principle applies to financial reporting, where the Group's joint operations follow their own financial risk policies, which may differ from those of Stora Enso. Unlike financial reporting, where joint operations

Shareholders comply with IFRS accounting standards, joint operations do not adhere to ESRS.

To ensure consistency with Stora Enso's financial reporting, the Sustainability Statement covers information proportional to Group's ownership in the joint operations in the following ESRS disclosure requirements: E1-5, E1-6, E1-7, E2-4, E3-4, E4-5, E5-4, E5-5, and S1-6 (total number of employees). These disclosures encompass all intensity ratios related to the Group's financial revenue. However, due to the lack of full authority over daily operations, joint operations are not governed by Stora Enso's policies, internal controls, or targets.

Following the double materiality principle, Stora Enso's Sustainability Statement contains relevant upstream and downstream value chain information where necessary to understand the Group's material impacts, risks, and opportunities and to provide information that meets the qualitative characteristics outlined in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In the descriptions of material topics, joint operations are referred to as 'joint operations' to distinguish them from the Group's own operations, over which the Group has full authority regarding the operating policies.

Due to the sensitivity of information, Stora Enso has exercised the option to not to disclose specific details related to intellectual property, know-how, or the outcomes of innovation. In accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act chapter 7 13 § (21.12.2023/1249), Stora Enso does not disclose information on impending developments or matters under negotiation. Following the Finnish Accounting Act, Stora Enso has also opted to omit value chain metrics and comparative data from previous periods for the first reporting year.

This Sustainability Statement has been verified by an independent thirdparty assurance provider in accordance with the Finnish Auditing Act. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has provided a level of Limited Assurance, using the ESRS Standards and the requirements of the delegated acts of the Taxonomy Regulation serving as criteria, covering the Sustainability Statement as defined under BP-1. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies the International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1. Additionally, a level of Reasonable Assurance, using the GHG Protocol as criteria, has been provided for Stora Enso's reporting on direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and 2). The Assurance Reports are available on page 216 of the Annual Report.

Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking's sustainability statement (ESRS IRO-2)

The below table presents a list of the disclosure requirements compiled in the Sustainability Statement. The material information has been determined based on the material impacts, risks and opportunities resulting from the Group's materiality assessment. After identifying material topical standards, the materiality was assessed on disclosure requirement and data point level. The materiality assessment process and the use of thresholds is described in ESRS 2 IRO-1.

Decarbonisation lever: fuel switches and use of renewable and nuclear energy

To reduce the carbon intensity of its industrial operations Stora Enso promotes the use of various forms of low carbon electricity and heat, including energy sources such as nuclear, wind, solar, and bioenergy. The Group's operations largely utilise renewable biomass fuels from forest and process side streams. Fuel switches are implemented in both production processes and transportation. To support its decarbonisation targets, Stora Enso purchases Guarantees of Origin to ensure that electricity has been generated from renewable or nuclear energy sources, with lower greenhouse gas emission factors. Examples of measures taken at the mills during the reporting year:

- An investment was completed to upgrade the chemical recovery line at the Imatra pulp mill in Finland. This enhancement involved improving the black liquor evaporation technology to increase the capacity of the recovery line. The higher dry matter content of black liquor improves energy efficiency and increases the share of biofuel.
- Renewal of the energy set-up and process equipment at the Heinola fluting site, Finland, to replace the remaining fossil-based fuels with renewable bioenergy. The expected GHG reduction is over 90%. Construction work is expected to be completed in the latter half of 2025.
- At the end of 2023, an investment project was completed at the Enocell pulp mill to replace fossil-based heavy fuel oil with renewable bioenergy, such as pitch oil. The use of bioenergy has continued through 2024, and the mill's goal is to fully replace heavy fuel oil with bioenergy.
- The Ala mill in Sweden achieved fossil-free operations in 2024 through efforts that include utilising bio and electric boilers for heat production, sourcing fossil-free electricity, and implementing a fuel change in the fleet, which now runs on renewable diesel and electricity.

In 2024, the emission reduction achieved for this decarbonisation lever was 0.86 million tonnes. The expected emission reduction by 2030 is 0.28 million tonnes.

Our strategy

In addition to the decarbonisation levers described above, site and production line closures, aligned with Stora Enso's business model and strategy, also impact the reduction of GHG emissions.

Accounting principles

Carbon stored by Stora Enso's products is calculated as the average carbon storage over 100 years from the harvest year, using the IPCC halflife methodology. The figure has been calculated by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) based on Stora Enso's forest and production figures (Climate effects of a forestry company - including biogenic carbon fluxes and substitution effects).

Our strategy

Our people

Governance

Shareholders

The forest carbon sink is calculated as the three-year average of annual CO2 sequestration in Stora Enso's owned or leased productive forest lands. The carbon stored in Stora Enso's productive forests is calculated as of end of the reporting year. In line with the Financial Statements, the figure contains the biological assets of the Group's joint operations proportional to the ownership share (50%). For further details, see Financial Statements, note 4.2 Forest assets.

Accounting methods for forest carbon sinks and storage are not standardised, and the chosen method and reporting period can influence the results. In sustainably managed forests, carbon sink and storage levels are maintained or increased throughout the forests' management cycle. During this cycle, factors such as harvesting and natural disturbances, growth rates related to forest ages and types, and other possible events can cause short-term variations in the carbon sinks and storage.

Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances (BP-2)

Stora Enso's Sustainability Statement fulfils the characteristics of specific circumstances in some of its disclosures.

Due to the nature of Stora Enso's operations, the time horizons differ from the definitions provided in the CSRD. For risks, Stora Enso defines short-term as up to one year, medium-term as two to ten years, and long-term as ten years or more. This definition aligns with Stora Enso's enterprise risk management process.

Stora Enso applies phase-in provisions in accordance with Appendix C of ESRS 1 and does not disclose anticipated monetary impacts of environmental risks for the financial year 2024. The phase-in provisions are applied to E1-9, E2-6, E3-5, E4-6, E5-6, S1-7, S1-8 (covers only EEA countries), S-11, S1-13, and S1-14 (88 d, e).

In cases involving value chain estimation, outcome uncertainty, and disclosures stemming from other legislation or generally accepted sustainability reporting pronouncements, the information is presented alongside the accounting principles of each metric. In ESRS E1-6, the metrics related to Scope 3 are subject to a higher level of measurement uncertainty, due to the data encompassing the full value chain.

Unless otherwise stated, the metrics disclosed in the Sustainability Statement have not been validated by an external body other than the assurance provider.

In 2024, these included the Company's net zero plan for 2040, an environmental incident at Stora Enso's harvesting site, the implementation plan for the due diligence process in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and an ESG update on market information and international remuneration disclosure practices. The description of the Board's involvement in the double materiality assessment and the setting of thresholds is presented under ESRS 2 IRO-1 and the outcome of the assessment is disclosed under ESRS 2 SBM-3.

The Board supervises the operation and management of Stora Enso and decides on significant matters relating to strategy, investments, organisation, and finance. Information on the development of essential risk areas, as well as executed and planned activities in these areas are regularly communicated to the FAC. SECo receives regular updates on material sustainability topics, including related impacts, risks and opportunities as described above. The two Committees present a report on each meeting to the Board to be utilised in the Board's approval, supervisory and decision-making processes. Risks are reviewed jointly with the FAC and SECo to ensure a holistic approach to overseeing Company risks. In accordance with the Board's working order, matters handled in the meetings include, among others, the approval of major investments and divestments. The Group's Investment Guidelines address sustainability matters to be considered, but do not provide specific guidance on potential trade-offs.

Accounting principles

Stora Enso measures the proportion of total supplier spend covered by its Supplier Code of Conduct for all categories and divisions. The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to all Stora Enso's sourcing categories globally. Joint operations, intellectual property rights (IPR), leasing fees, financial trading, government fees such as customs, and wood purchases from private individual forest owners are not obliged to accept the Supplier Code of Conduct. The total supplier spend excludes the aforementioned items.

Our strategy

Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC)

The SCoC outlines minimum standards for suppliers in addition to applicable laws and regulations. The policy lists objectives for responsible business practices, occupational health and safety, human and labour rights, supporting and engaging with communities, and protecting the environment. It requires suppliers to actively monitor, report, and work to reduce GHG emissions from their own operations and value chain. The supplier must allow Stora Enso, or a third party authorised by Stora Enso, to verify compliance with the requirements of this SCoC through dialogue, disclosure of information or, if considered necessary by Stora Enso, an audit of the supplier's operations. The policy also addresses managing the negative impacts resulting from GHG emissions in the Group's value chain.

The scope of the policy covers all Stora Enso's business activities and operations globally. Accountability for the implementation of the SCoC lies with the EVP, Head of each division. The SCoC is provided to suppliers during the pre-qualification process, where they are required to commit to adhering to it.

Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC)

The SCoC is a legally binding document that imposes sustainability requirements on Stora Enso's suppliers and needs to be signed as part of the pre-qualification. In addition to environmental topics, the SCoC covers areas such as human and labour rights, involuntary labour, occupational health and safety, ethical recruitment, and fair remuneration. The SCoC helps manage material risk related to the breach of these requirements occurring in the Group's own operations or upstream value chain. The policy obliges suppliers to respect the ILO Convention 138 on abolition of child labour. It does not explicitly address precarious work. See ESRS E1-2 for more details on the SCoC.

The policy, which addresses the risk and actual negative impact related to the safety of workers in the value chain working at the Group's sites and premises is outlined in ESRS S1-1.

By the end of 2024, Stora Enso had not become aware of any severe cases of human rights incidents related to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises that involve value chain workers. The Group is informed of incidents of non-respect through internal audits, grievance mechanisms, and third-party supplier audits, which include aspects such as occupational safety and labour rights.

Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-4)
Climate change mitigation

In 2017, Stora Enso established a science-based target to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieved this target nine years ahead of schedule. In 2021, Stora Enso raised its ambition to align with the 1.5degree scenario. The updated target is to reduce absolute CO 2 eq emissions in both its own production (Scope 1 and 2) and within the value chain (Scope 3) by 50% by 2030 from the 2019 baseline. The targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are aligned with the Group's Energy and Climate Change Policy.

For setting the targets, Stora Enso uses a publicly available science-based target-setting method for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions called the Absolute Contraction Approach. Since the targets are set for absolute emission reductions, the possible future developments, such as changes in sales volumes or shifts in customer demand, will not alter the targets. GHG removals, carbon credits or avoided emissions are not considered as means to achieve the targets. See accounting principles for GHG emissions in ESRS E1-6.

In 2023, Stora Enso reinforced its climate commitment by joining The Climate Pledge initiative, aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2040, across all three Scope categories. The 2019 base year applies to both the 2023 and 2040 targets. As the target is set for absolute emission reductions, future developments, such as changes in sales volumes or shifts in customer demand, will not alter the target. See the accounting principles for GHG emissions in ESRS E1-6.

By the end of 2024, Stora Enso achieved a -53% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to base year 2019, surpassing the target set for 2030. The decarbonisation levers and related contribution in reductions are disclosed in the graph 'Achieved and planned reductions within the Group's own operations'. For Scope 3, Stora Enso achieved a -39% reduction by the end of 2024.

Our strategy

E1 disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3

Aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, Stora Enso utilises scenarios to assess climate change impacts. Stora Enso has tested the resilience of its strategy and business model in relation to climate change through multiple resilience analyses conducted over the past years. These analyses focused on the Group's core business and certain operations that might be more exposed to risks due to their location. No material physical climate change impact risks before 2040 were identified. Resilience analyses have been conducted for Stora Enso's own operations, covering production assets in Sweden, Finland, Poland, and Belgium, as well as for the forest assets in Sweden. In addition, resilience analyses have been conducted for Stora Enso's joint operations in Brazil and Uruguay and the plantations in South America.

The scenario analyses for the operational assets for Stora Enso's own operations and upstream operations (joint operations) were conducted as desktop studies by reviewing location-based historical weather data against five different climate scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP5-8.5). For forest assets in Sweden, the study was done as a literature review by a third-party. The analysis for the upstream value chain covering plantations in South America was conducted by a third party. The time horizon on materiality was set to 2040, with an overall horizon extending to 2100.

Stora Enso assumes that the transition to a lower-carbon and resilient economy will affect the Group through emission reductions, regulations, and the need to adapt operations, for example, by electrification.

The results of the resilience analysis show that operational assets in Sweden and Finland have endured similar weather conditions in the past. Stora Enso acknowledges that weather extremes will become more frequent, but there is little evidence to suggest that those would have a material impact on the ability to operate assets before 2040. Assets located in continental Europe, are at a higher risk of climate hazards compared to those in the Nordics. However, no material impact was identified. The results of the resilience analysis for forest assets in Sweden were inconclusive. A warmer climate enhances forest growth, but at the same time, more frequent storms, drought, and pest damage may negatively affect growth. Based on the outcome, there are both risks and opportunities in the changing climate. There is uncertainty in the resilience analysis, as recent climate development suggests that expected time horizons for impacts in different scenarios might be shorter than anticipated. In 2024, the EU's climate service reported that for the first time, global warming had exceeded 1.5°C over the course of an entire year.

Based on the resilience analysis, Stora Enso has the ability to adjust or adapt its strategy to respond to climate change in the short, medium, and long term. Climate-related transition risks relate to Stora Enso's capability

Shareholders to reduce its emissions across the value chain, and also its capability to position its business offering to support the global transition to a lowcarbon, circular economy. Stora Enso's operations and value chain benefit from their wide geographical distribution, as it is unlikely that all locations would be impacted simultaneously. In 2021, Stora Enso assessed a business impact scenario that identified climate-related transition opportunity. The results concluded that the overall transition to a low carbon, circular economy is aligned with the Group's strategy.

ESRS E1  Climate change
Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)

In 2021, Stora Enso updated its transition plan for climate change mitigation to ensure that its strategy and business model are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, in line with the Paris Agreement.  The transition plan was approved by the Group Leadership Team in 2021. As part of the transition plan update, Stora Enso undertook the following efforts:

- Set climate targets, which are compatible with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees in line with the Paris Agreement. These targets align with the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) 1.5-degree pathway, as explained in ESRS E1-4.
- To align the compatibility of the Group's business model with the transition plan, Stora Enso has established mitigation efforts as defined in ESRS E1-3. The decarbonisation levers for climate change mitigation in the Group's own operations include enhancements in energy efficiency, investments in electrification, fuel switches, and the use of renewable energy.

Key significant investments related to climate change mitigation actions are disclosed in ESRS E1-3. The transition plan aligns with the Group's strategy, and incorporates climate-related scenario analysis, which has been used to inform the strategy. Some of the decarbonisation levers link directly to the Group's product portfolio, placing the transition plan at the core of the business model. The climate mitigation actions are included in the financial planning described in ESRS E1-3.

At the end of 2024, Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 eq emissions totalled 1.23 million tonnes or -53% less, and Scope 3 emissions 4.53 million tonnes or -39% less than in the base year 2019. In terms of potential locked-in GHG emissions, Stora Enso acknowledges that future investments and new technology are essential to achieve its climate targets. Therefore, the Group intends to continue investments in low-carbon and energy-efficient solutions, particularly to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Actions and investments are further described in ESRS E1-3 and presented as part of the graph 'Achieved and expected reductions' in ESRS E1-4.

Stora Enso reports according to the EU Taxonomy. The forest industry is not central to current legislation, limiting Stora Enso's relevant economic activities for reporting. However, opportunities to expand taxonomy alignment exist in forestry activities where the Group seeks a partner to perform EU Taxonomy-compliant verification, as forest certification audits do not fully meet the criteria. In 2024, Stora Enso's taxonomyaligned capex was EUR 64 million, see section EU Taxonomy. Stora Enso is not excluded from the EU-Paris aligned benchmarks.

The net amount of the parent company's unrealised cash flow hedge loss in the fair value reserve was EUR -2.2 (14.3) million, which was related to currency and interest rate derivatives. Currency and interest rate derivatives also include a gain of EUR 0.2 (0.2) million related to the time value of options. These unrealised gains are recognised in the income statement upon the maturity of the hedging contracts. The longest hedging contract will mature in 2027. However, the majority of the contracts are expected to mature during 2025. The ineffective portions of hedges are recognised as adjustments to financial items, revenue or materials and services according to the hedged item. During 2024 and 2023, there were no material ineffectiveness related to hedges recognised in the income statement. Derivatives used in currency cash flow hedges are mainly forward contracts and options. Swaps are mainly used in commodity hedges and interest rate cash flow hedges.

1 After the finalisation of winding down of their related operations, the share series C2, V and M were dissolved during 2024.

The valuation of PVO in 2024 amounted to EUR 570 (778) million. The decrease in PVO's valuation is mainly due to a decrease in electricity price estimates, netted with impact from lower discount rate. No deferred tax is recognised, as under Finnish tax regulations, holdings above 10% are exempt from tax on disposal proceeds.

Human Rights Policy and Guidelines

Stora Enso works to ensure that human rights are respected throughout its operations and business relationships. It takes human rights into account across its operations from investment decisions onwards, paying special attention to vulnerable groups, and encourages its partners to do the same. The Human Rights Policy outlines Stora Enso' commitment to ensuring respect for human rights following the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The policy requires suppliers and other business partners to respect human and labour rights and comply with the Group's policies and guidelines. The Human Rights Guidelines address the salient human rights topics, such as fair labour, access to grievance mechanisms, and children's rights. Stora Enso strives to prevent and eliminate all forms of forced labour in its operations and supply chains, including modern slavery, child labour, and debt bondage. Both the policy and guidelines aim to mitigate the prevention of the risk of noncompliance with Stora Enso's standards in the Group's own operations and upstream value chain. See further details on the Human Rights Policy, Human Rights Guidelines, and adherence to internationally recognised human and labour rights and standards in ESRS S1-1.

Through the Human Rights Policy, Stora Enso commits to engaging with affected and potentially affected stakeholders, including value chain workers, to ensure that its approach and focus are valid. Stora Enso is committed to remedy situations where its activities have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts and engages with affected stakeholders in finding the most appropriate solution. These solutions are dependent on the needs of the affected people and the details of the case.

Employee engagement
Ways of working in a decentralised model
Our positive performance culture

Stora Enso strives to understand employee perspectives and measure progress on our People Promise. We continuously adjust and refine our approach to support teams growth and improve through the all-employee survey, Engage. In year 2024 we ran a global survey as well as several divisional surveys to support the development of our decentralised operating model. The global survey conducted in 2024, had a response rate of 79%. The engagement score was 7.8, slightly above the industry benchmark.

In 2024, Stora Enso made further progress in identifying optimal practices within its decentralised operating model. This approach aims to empower our divisions, create leaner Group functions, and increase customer-centricity. These efforts have involved organisational changed management across the company. Throughout this process, we have carefully adhered to national, union, and Works Council guidance, while providing managers and employees with continuous support and communication through various channels

To foster a positive performance culture, we introduced the concept of 4As at the end of 2023.

| 1. Locate: Interface withnature    | Mapping of Stora Enso's direct operations, including forest assets, using geospatial data to identify proximity to sensitive locations by utilising the Integrated biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) and WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Guiding questions: • Which of the Group's activities are located in sensitive areas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Stora Enso manages its ownandleased forest land, covering a total area of 2.1 million hectares worldwide. Largest part is boreal forests located in Sweden (68% of total forest area) and in Finland and the Baltics (15%) via Tornator (41% ownership). Stora Enso also owns and leases eucalyptus plantations in China (3%), Brazil (6%), and Uruguay (7%). Stora Enso's Forest Resources Information Systems include locations of the Company's forest assets and sensitive areas, aiding in effective forestmanagementand conservation planning. Moreover, Stora Enso employs third-party verified woodtraceability systems to know the origin of procured woodandensuring that it is not sourced from sensitive areas. Stora Enso operates 57 production facilities mainly in Northern, Western, and Central Europe, but also has operations in China and via joint ventures in Brazil and Uruguay. According to the mapping assessment, five of the Group's units operate in regions with High Baseline Water Stress and five units with High Biodiversity Significances. These units are defined as material locations and are disclosed in the section "Sustainability data by production unit" of the Annual Report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The Group's impact on living organisms, people, and the environment originates from use of land, renewable and non-renewable resources, and the generation of waste, emissions, effluents, and noise. Location-specific nature and environmental impact assessments are performed in local managementsystems (ISO 14001) where significant environmental aspects are determined and prioritised. These systems also monitor compliance with environmental permits and managethe chemical and ecological status in local recipient control systems. Stora Enso has, as a business with over 20,000 suppliers around the world, an important role within global supply chains to influence upstream suppliers positively on nature, biodiversity, environmental health, humanwell-being, and business perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3. Assess: Risks& opportunities    | The basis for the risk and opportunities assessment was based on the TNFD sector guidance for Forestry, pulp and paper and the double materiality assessment (DMA) process implemented for the reporting according to Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. This approach is also integrated into the ERM process, including climate scenario analysis. During 2024, Stora Enso executed in-depth assessments on Group-level, for two mills, and an upstream pilot for one of the divisions. Guiding questions: • What are the nature-related risks and opportunities for the organisation? • Which risks and opportunities are material and should be prioritised? | The scenario analysis recognises that long-term changes in precipitation patterns, periods of drought, frequent extreme weather events, and higher average temperatures that increase the risk of forest fires and insect outbreaks, could causedamageto operations, forests, and tree plantations. This would affect forests asset values and regional woodprices. More frequent extreme weather events also increase the risk of disruptions in the production, logistics, and supply of raw materials and energy. Reputational risks mayarise as a consequence of incidents or non-compliant behaviour, including failure to comply with norms, laws and regulations, or policy documents. DamagetoStora Enso's reputation and brand mayresult in a loss of investor and customer confidence leading to higher cost of capital and decreased revenues. There is a risk that newpolicies and regulations for forestry and biodiversity could limit harvesting levels in EU forests, potentially resulting in significant increases in woodprices and supply limitations. This could lead to reduced competitiveness of products. Owning forests provides Stora Enso with strategic advantages, including securing a reliable and consistent woodsupply, reducing reliance on external suppliers, promoting environmental stewardship through sustainable forestry practices, preserving and actively managing biodiversity, working with conservation of protected areas, and contributing to carbon sequestration efforts. Stora Enso has adopted an adaptive approach to biodiversity managementandmonitors progress with indicators, and then adapts actions accordingly. The Group also uses the latest technologies, data, and modelling to predict future biodiversity based on current managementpractices. |

ESRS E4  Biodiversity and ecosystems
Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model (E4-1)

In 2021, Stora Enso introduced a new sustainability agenda centred around three focus areas: climate, biodiversity, and circularity. This was preceded by an assessment of Stora Enso's business model and strategic resilience in relation to future key sustainability risks and opportunities. The assessment process engaged internal stakeholders from all divisions, while also seeking input from external experts. The assessment did not include consultations with affected communities. The assessment's time horizons were set to 2030 and 2050.

The assessment's focus was on transition events, such as increasing legislation and external stakeholder pressure. These key risks are further described in SBM-3. The resilience assessment covered Stora Enso's own operations and incorporated a number of scientific studies and analysis, one of the most important being the Planetary Boundary concept by Stockholm Resilience Center. The concept identifies nine planetary boundaries, and crossing them leads to physical, systemic risks that are a threat to society. In 2021, two of the planetary boundaries - climate change and biodiversity loss - were crossed, both relevant for Stora Enso. Since then, four more boundaries have been crossed. The analysis did not cover the upstream and downstream value chain.

The results of the analysis indicated that biodiversity loss is proceeding at an accelerated speed, and stakeholders expect companies to address systematic climate and biodiversity related risks beyond their own industries. The conducted analysis indicates that in order to future-proof Stora Enso's business and strategy, it is imperative for its operations and products to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere and contribute to halting biodiversity loss. Additionally, responsible business practices should be implemented to ensure that the Group operates within the defined planetary boundaries for other Earth systems, such as freshwater use.

As an outcome, Stora Enso established a transition plan designed for driving new opportunities and future-proofing the Group's business in an environment that is constantly changing on an accelerated pace. For biodiversity, a target was established on achieving a net-positive impact on biodiversity in the Group's own forests and plantations by 2050. The long-term goal is supported by a set of biodiversity indicators, with defined intermediate targets. The transition plan for climate is presented under ESRS E1-1.
