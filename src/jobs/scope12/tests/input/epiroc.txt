#### Scope 1 and 2

A process is in place to evaluate whether we have reached our goal of 95% coverage of Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
However for 2024 this coverage was not reached.
We will continue to expand the scope next year to reach 100%.
The shortfall is explained by the previous exclusion of CO2e emissions from company vehicles operating outside our facilities as their impact was initially perceived as small.
Adding the scope of company vehicles this year revealed that this portion of CO2e emissions represents a larger share than previously anticipated.
Customer centers currently not included in the reporting scope are also estimated to have a higher portion than expected.

##### Scope 2

The calculation of CO2e emissions of indirect energy ie energy purchased externally by the company includes electricity district heating and cooling used at the sites.
All production sites distribution centers and major emitting customers centers are included.

### CO2e emissions from own operations (Scope 1 and 2)
### Description

Actual negative impact Own operations Short term Medium term Long term

### CO2e emissions from transport (Scope 3)

We work broadly to reduce CO2e emissions from upstream and downstream transportation.
CO2e emissions in vehicles owned or controlled by the Epiroc Group are included in Scope 1 and 2.
One example is the use of more sea freight and less air freight which has led to a substantial reduction of CO2e emissions during several years.
We have also established regional distribution centers reduced freight and improved the availability of parts and consumables reducing the need for transportation.
We have made good progress in reducing CO2e emissions over the past years but reaching our reduction target also depends on the transport sector's own transition.

In 2024 the reporting scope expanded to include major emitting customer centers which explains the majority of the increase in CO2e emissions.
For comparable units excluding new reporting units and customer centers in 2024 the CO2e emissions increased by 9%.
The increase is mainly due to global logistic constraints including geopolitical tensions conflicts and strikes which caused route diversions and increased transport lead times in ocean freight necessitating the use of more airfreight.

#### Outside of scopes

Outside of scopes includes biogenic CO2 factors that are used to account for the direct carbon dioxide (CO2) impact of burning biomass and biofuels.
Standardized emission factors published by DEFRA (UK) are used to calculate outside of scope CO2e emissions.

- 1) The scope Company vehicles was added to the reporting in 2024 and restated in the base year.

- 2) Major emitting customer centers were added to the reporting in 2024 and restated in the base year.

- 3) The 2024 data incorporates lifecycle emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA) (in the past only direct combustion) and a couple of previously omitted products have been added. The base year figures have been updated accordingly.

- 4) Reflecting the update of electricity emission factors applied in 2024 and the addition of products omitted, the 2023 outcome would have been approximately 7% higher. If a restatement would have been done, this would have implied a reduction in the CO2e emissions between 2023 and 2024.

### CO2e emissions from operations (Scope 1 and 2)

| Our energy-efficiency program, launched in 2019, continued in 2024. This program involves investments in renewable energy as well as in energy efficiency. A challenge is the unavailability of electricity grids providing renewable electricity in certain geographies, which influences our ability to meet our goals. We meet this challenge by, e.g., installing solar panels. This is also a way for us to contribute to the increasing need for renewable electricity. Our first solar panels were installed in India in 2019, followed by facilities in Australia, China, South Africa, Sweden and USA. In 2024, 15% of our production facilities had solar panels installed. | CO2e emissions from company vehicles were 18 ktonnes, with the largest share occurring in service operations. For 2024, the focus has been to establish the base year emis- sions, measure the current year’s outcome and establish a reduction plan to meet our 2030 goal. CO2e emissions for purchased goods and services (Scope 3) Since 2022, we have measured CO2e emissions from pur- chased goods and services, and our top emitter categories and suppliers have thereafter been identified. 2024 is the first year we report this externally. The CO2e emissions for purchased goods and services for 2024 were 770 ktonnes, showing a decrease compared with the previous year mainly explained by lower purchased spend, including price reduc- tions. Read more about our calculation methodology and scope of data in the Greenhouse accounting methodology section. |
![table image]({page: 94, x: 68}, {y: 490, {width: 447}, {height: 108})

By installing our own solar panels and improving energy efficiency to reduce energy reliance we mitigate the impact of possible rising energy prices due to geopolitical events.
The actual and potential availability of renewable energy and energy cost levels are considered when choosing locations for new production sites.

We have a process to evaluate whether we have reached our goal of at least 95% coverage of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
However for 2024 this coverage was not reached.
We will continue to expand the scope next year to achieve 100%.
Read more in section Greenhouse accounting methodology.

For comparable units excluding the new reporting units in 2024 CO2e emissions from on site energy consumption decreased by 17% compared with the previous year due to lower production volumes than planned shifts to renewable energy energy efficiency initiatives and increased own During the year our sourcing organization was strength ened with additional resources for the integration of sustain ability into sourcing processes.
We actively engage with our suppliers to reduce their CO2e emissions.
Activities in our sup plier engagement strategy including achieving CO2e reduc tions have been defined based on a supplier sustainability maturity assessment.
In 2024 we communicated the expecta tion for suppliers to commit to the Paris Agreement goals and actively work to reduce their emissions.
We gather input from them on their plans to achieve these reductions and monitor whether they have aligned with the Paris Agreement goals.
Preference is given to those engaged in the SBTi showcasing their dedication to sustainability.


<!-- PAGE: 95 -->
Partnerships with suppliers are important for us and our customers to reach our climate goals.
One example is the partnership with SSAB where we have collaborated on using fossil free steel in the production of Epiroc's mining equipment as well as exploring the possibilities of using fossil free steel when manufacturing spare parts and components with additive technology.
Another initiative is the SSAB Zero™ which is based on recycled steel and produced using fossil free energy sources and logistics solutions.
In 2023 we signed a delivery agreement for SSAB Zero™ and in 2024 we introduced it in the production of our mine trucks and loaders in Sweden.

###### Responsible Sales Assessment Process Implemented.9) Goal: 100%

#### Scope 3
##### Purchased goods and services (category 1)

The calculation of CO2e emissions from purchased goods and services uses a spend based methodology where spend based data is multiplied by emission factors from Exiobase and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Emission factors have not been adjusted for inflation.
These emissions cover direct sourcing and account for approximately 70% of total purchased spend in direct sourcing.
The current gap in completeness is mainly explained by data accessibility issues due to recent large acquisitions.
The indirect sourcing would add approximately 21% emissions to this category had it been included.
Indirect and direct souring are explained in ESRS S2.

Due to the lower reliability and accuracy with spend based calculation method work is ongoing to move towards a hybrid methodology using a mix of spend based weight based and supplier specific calculation methodology.
Weight based calculation methodology uses the actual weight of materials and components while supplier specific methodology uses precise data from suppliers.
With future more accurate data restatements of historical data may occur.

###### Market-based method

A market based method reflects emissions from indirect energy (electricity and district heating) that an organization has purposefully chosen (or its lack of choice).
Standardized country factors published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used to calculate CO2e emissions for indirect energy when factors have not been provided by a supplier.
An emission factor of zero has been used for renewable energy connected with an energy attribute certificate (EAC).

###### Location-based method

A location based method reflects the average GHG emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs using mostly grid average emission factor data.
Standardized country factors published by International Energy Agency (IEA) are used to calculate CO2e emissions for all indirect energy.

### Description

The majority of our CO2e emissions occur in the use phase of our sold products.
This includes total expected lifetime emissions of sold products at our customers’ operation sites from all relevant products sold in the reporting year.
We are contributing to these CO2e emissions by selling the products to the customers but we are also enabling reduction of these emissions through our product offering and by engaging with customers.

Actual negative impact Downstream Short term Medium term Long term

Actual positive impact Downstream Short term Medium term Long term

###### Upstream Downstream

Approximately 2% of our total value chain carbon footprint comes from the transportation of materials and components to our facilities and the delivery of finished products to customers. In addition CO2e emissions from business travel represent approximately 0.6% of the total value chain carbon footprint. We focus our efforts on transportation of materials components and finished products. These transports include third party transportation of goods throughout our supply chain from first tier supplier to end customer including materials for manufacturing components for assembly finished products and spare parts. Transport by air sea train and road is included. Short term Medium term Long term Examples of how we have reduced these CO2e emissions include establishment of regional distribution centers and an ongoing shift from air to sea freight. We expect freight companies to transition to lower emission options and rely on their continued progress.

Material impacts risks and opportunities

CO2e emissions in customer operations

CO2e emissions from the use phase of Epiroc's sold products (Scope 3)

### Description

CO2e emissions from our operations mainly from our production facilities and company vehicles contribute to global warming.
Although these emissions represent less than 1% of our total value chain carbon footprint reducing them is important as only we can address them directly.
This is why we have implemented initiatives such as an ongoing renewable energy program and energy efficiency activities.

Prioritizing access to renewable energy is an important consideration when selecting operational locations.
A challenge is the unavailability of renewable electricity in certain geographies which affects our ability to meet our goals.
We address this through initiatives such as increased energy efficiency in our processes and solar panel installations.
This is also a way for us to contribute to the increasing need for renewable electricity.

CO2e emissions from the extraction of raw material and production related to the components we purchase for our operations represent approximately 11% of our total value chain carbon footprint.
We have identified the relatively few suppliers that account for the majority of the emissions.
The top emitting categories are raw material weldments hydraulics and powertrains.
We gather input from our suppliers about their plans to achieve CO2e emissions reductions and Paris Agreement goals.
Preference is given to those engaged in the SBTi.
Partnerships and collaborations with suppliers are also important to us.
Our partnership with SSAB on fossil free steel and recycled steel is one example of how we are reducing the carbon footprint from produced steel.

##### Risk Downstream Short-term Medium-term Long-term

- Emissions-free products do not emit exhaust gas or other pollution from the onboard source of power, also referred to as zero tailpipe emissions.

##### Emissions-free* and energy-efficient products can enable decarbonization and healthier workplaces Failure to innovate emissions-free* and energy-efficient solutions can risk market share loss

Our customers’ goals for CO2e emission reduction and healthier workplaces are expected to drive demand for our emissions free* as well as our energy efficient products and connected solutions especially in regions with stringent regulations.
Epiroc continues to invest significantly in R&D acquisitions and partnerships to support customers’ CO2e emission reduction efforts.
This will differentiate us in the market strengthen customer relationships through alignment with their decarbonization goals diversify revenue streams and increase revenue growth.

Emissions free* products reduce the negative impact on customers’ employees’ health by protecting them from fumes noise and heat especially in underground operations (read more in ESRS S2).
They also reduce the energy need for ventilation a major cost for underground mines.
Failing to develop launch and market new products or respond to technological development and customer demand for these products could lead to loss of market share.
If this risk materializes it will impact our competitive positioning and result in lower revenue and profitability.
Proactive measures can mitigate these effects.
There is a risk that some customers’ ambitions may not be realized into action or not at the pace expected which could result in our products not being prioritized in their actual CO2e emission reduction efforts.
Financial implications include potential revenue loss from slower adoption and increased customer support costs.
One example of this is customer caution in investing in electrification technology.
Delays and interpretation uncertainties in regulations from governmental bodies investments needed in electric infrastructure and limited access to renewable electricity could hinder customers\' willingness to invest.

### Greenhouse accounting methodology

Greenhouse gas emission reporting is carried out in accordance with the GHG Protocol (www.ghgprotocol.org).
CO2e emissions include the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20).

##### Use phase of sold products (category 11)

Unique operation cycles for each product are defined.
CO2e emissions from use phase are calculated based on diesel usage electricity usage and life length.
For diesel emission factors from DEFRA (UK) are used where diesel with average content of biodiesel is used.
IEA national emission factors are used for CO2e emissions from electricity use where an average emission factor is used based on the countries where the products in each product family are sold.
These IEA national emission factors have been expanded from previous direct combustion to also include upstream emissions from fuels and emissions from transmission and distribution losses in order to reflect full life cycle emissions from electricity.
In the reporting scope all products carrying their own energy source on board (diesel engine electrical motor and compressor) are included.
Products without their own energy source are excluded such as drilling equipment with an external compressor and hydraulic attachments.

| E3-4 | Water consumption |
![table image]({page: 103, x: 57}, {y: 504, {width: 96}, {height: 7})

Epiroc's KPIs related to water withdrawal are limited to our own operations.
The total water withdrawal is monitored quarterly.
We have a Group KPI for the efficiency of water withdrawal in water stressed areas.
We currently do not measure nor have any targets relating to our upstream or downstream value chain.

We have measured the water withdrawal from major entities in our own operations for several years but limited the disclosure to entities in water stressed areas.
Our water consumption is not material as we do not incorporate water into products and most of the water withdrawn is discharged back to the sewerage system.

Our Environmental Principles include minimizing water usage.
We conduct annual water risk mapping using data from a third party risk analytics firm.
Each year we set a target to maintain low water withdrawal levels per cost of sales (COS) for companies located in high water risk areas.
For 2024 the target was to remain below 3.30 m3/COS MSEK.
The actual result was 3.37 m3/COS MSEK due to lower COS than planned.
The target scope includes 34 entities that were part of Epiroc as of January 2024 and are located in water stressed areas.
The absolute water withdrawal in comparable entities was reduced by 13 172 m3 in 2024.

The total water withdrawal for entities included in water stressed areas in 2024 were 147 388 m3 including newly acquired companies and comprises 47 entities.
The total water withdrawal for entities included in the water target were 126 260 m3.

Our total water withdrawal of 260 159 m3 includes 79 entities and is measured regardless of water stress level and target scope.

### Locked-in GHG emissions

Locked in GHG emissions occur when fossil fuel based infrastructure or assets whether new or existing remain in use even though emissions free* alternatives are available.
This prolongs reliance on high emissions systems delaying the phase out of fossil fuels.
Locked in emissions within our own operations would trigger the transition risk of not achieving the CO2e emissions reduction in line with our 2030 climate goals.
Read more about our climate related risks and opportunities in the section Climate change impacts risks and opportunities.

More than 80% of our value chain CO2e emissions occur when our customers use our products (Scope 3).
Although most of our machines are equipped with combustion engines we are actively working to enable the use of renewable fuels and provide battery conversions to facilitate the transition to equipment with less or no tailpipe emissions.

The lifespan of mining equipment can vary significantly depending on the type of equipment its usage and the maintenance practices in place.
Generally the limited life expectancy which does not extend beyond 2050 will enable a transition to equipment with zero tailpipe emissions to achieve net zero operations in the future.

We do not consider Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions as locked in as we can directly influence our own operations.
We have and will continue to implement actions to reduce these emissions ensuring they do not jeopardize the achievement of our 2030 goals.
Our achieved emission reduction in our on site operations demonstrates our success in monitoring and managing emissions from our key assets.

### CO2e emissions from use of sold products (Scope 3)

The majority of our CO2e emissions occur in the use phase of our sold products and here we can make the largest impact.
We have a clear ambition to help our customers by providing multiple solutions such as automation electrification and service to support them in their efforts to achieve their CO2e emissions reduction targets see illustration on page 41.

In 2024 the CO2e emissions from the use of our products increased by 1% compared with 2023.
Adjusting the 2023 result with the updated emission factors in 2024 and the previously omitted products the CO2e emissions would be reduced by 6%.
This reduction is explained by changes in sales volumes changed product mix with increased sales of electrified products and impact from energy efficiency programs.
However the potential impact of reducing emissions from customers using HVO renewable diesel has not been taken into account.
HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) is a renewable diesel fuel made from waste fats and oils.
It offers a cleaner alternative to traditional diesel reducing GHG emissions throughout its lifecycle.

Fossil fuel dependency is likely to continue in our sector for some time but a shift to renewable fuels and electrified operations is expected in the coming years along with customers’ decarbonization journey.
One of our long term goals is to offer a full range of emissions free (see definition on page 93) products by 2025 for underground and by 2030 for surface operations.
Our offering includes battery electric underground drill rigs loaders and trucks.
All our underground drill rigs are powered by electricity during drilling operations.
For surface operations our range of electric and energy efficient drill rigs significantly reduces CO2e emissions and fuel consumption.
Today 42% (42) of our product fleet is available as electrified solutions and the demand is expected to increase in the years to come.
Battery technology and cable connected equipment are two important solutions that enable zero emissions operations provided renewable energy is available for charging.
For more information on electrification see pages 28-31.

Through partnerships we can accelerate the transformation and reach a steep curve in mining technology innovation.
Our partnership with Boliden and ABB led to successful deployment of the first fully battery electric trolley truck system in Sweden on an 800 meter long underground mine test with a 13% incline.
Boliden intends to implement a full scale autonomous electric trolley system in the Ravliden mine and has placed an order for four Minetruck Trolley trucks (MT42 SG) from Epiroc.
Once achieved a result will be significant carbon emissions reductions compared with a mine using conventional technology and it will be part of setting a standard for new mines.
A Minetruck Trolley truck (MT42 SG) compared with a diesel propelled truck reduces the CO2e significantly given that no fossil fuel is used during operation.
Additionally this truck significantly reduces the need for ventilation at a mine site compared with diesel versions.
A case study comparing the operation of three MT42 S trucks with MT42 SG Trolley trucks showed that the diesel trucks required five times more ventilation than the trolley trucks.
Not all energy and CO2e emissions reduction improvements involve electrification.
One way is to enable the use of renewable fuels in existing machines.
Selected Epiroc surface drill rigs produced from 2023 along with underground drill rigs mine trucks and loaders produced from 2022 have been verified to be compatible with HVO renewable diesel and/or available as electric versions.
These advancements significantly reduce particulates and other harmful substances including greenhouse gases.
We have started to deliver machines filled up with HVO renewable diesel to encourage customers to transition from diesel to HVO renewable diesel.
Another example of lowering CO2e emissions from our products includes energy efficiency improvements such as more efficient engines and electric drivetrains.
For example the new Minetruck MT66 S eDrive is the first of Epiroc's large capacity mine trucks to feature the latest generation electric drivetrain and holds several other upgrades such as weight reduction increased speed and payload as well as better utilization of the engine.
While the Minetruck MT66 S eDrive enables increased productivity compared with other high capacity mine trucks it also reduces fuel consumption by up to 7% compared with previous models.
Another way to reduce emissions includes automation which is a driver for improving energy efficiency while at the same time lowering the cost of ownership and increasing productivity and safety.

## 1. Definition of the scope of ESG matters

Epiroc's value chain was mapped and research was conducted on relevant sustainability topics for the company its value chain and industry.
We gathered insight from analyzing indus try peers and future trends ESG ratings data from an external risk data provider investor focus areas previous materiality assessments Epiroc's enterprise risk assessment process and strategic plans.
After excluding irrelevant topics a comprehen sive list of relevant sustainability matters was established.

Positive impacts were assessed based on scale scope and likelihood while negative impacts were assessed based on severity (consisting of scope irremediable character and scale) and likelihood.
Topics concerning activities that do not occur in Epiroc's value chain (for example the topic Animal welfare) or that are not relevant due to our business struc ture (for example the topic Social inclusion of consumers) were considered irrelevant for the assessment.
For human rights impacts severity took priority over likelihood.
Risks and opportunities were assessed based on their magnitude and likelihood of occurrence.
Numerical scales were used to quantify these factors.
However when determining materiality qualitative and varying degrees of subjective judgment was needed.
All sub-topics were scored at a gross level.

## Own workforce impacts, risks, and opportunities
### With reference to

| SBM-3 | Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model |
| Epiroc’s entire workforce, including employees and external workforce, is included in the scope of identifying material impacts. Epiroc had 18 874 employees and 1 495 external workforce in more than 60 countries at the end of 2024. Employees are directly employed by an Epiroc company, and external workforce includes both self-employed people and people employed by a third-party company but working for Epiroc. The total workforce includes people working in areas such as service, supply chain, production, administration, marketing, sales and support, and research and development. The potential failure to attract and retain key teams and employees could hinder Epiroc’s ability to sustain or expand certain business areas. This is an underlying risk for identified material IROs, all of which impact the attraction and retention of personnel. | Epiroc has operations and employees in regions where challenges exist in terms of upholding international labor rights conventions and ensuring decent working conditions, such as adequate employment conditions and the rights to freedom of assembly and association. Regions particularly vulnerable to these issues include parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Latin America. Gender diversity is a challenge – not only to us at Epiroc, but for the entire mining and construction industry. Women make up about 15% of the mining workforce and the share in the construction industry is even lower, according to the World Bank. |

Material impacts risks and opportunities

#### Basis for preparation
##### With reference to

| BP-1 | General basis for preparation of the sustainability statement |
| BP-2 | Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances |
![table image]({page: 75, x: 57}, {y: 596, {width: 187}, {height: 7})

This report is Epiroc's seventh sustainability report written in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Stand ards.
During 2024 we continued our preparations for the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) which will apply in Sweden and for Epiroc from the financial year 2025.
Epiroc has adopted a gradual approach to CSRD beginning to report in line with this directive.
The CSRD reporting requirements and its European Sustain ability Reporting Standards (ESRS) have guided the content and structure of this 2024 sustainability statement.
The EU Commission's Omnibus proposal presented in February 2025 has not been considered for this report.

Epiroc is a signatory to the UN Global Compact.
This report discloses performance in relation to the UN Global Compact's ten principles.
The information is also made available on UN Global Compact's website see www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants.

The report includes information on material topics where Epiroc has actual or potential significant environmental social and governance impacts as well as indirect impacts along the value chain.
It also covers financial risks and oppor tunities related to sustainability matters.
The report pro vides details on how these impacts are managed and offers information for understanding Epiroc's development and performance.
Any forward looking statements both textual and numerical are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and often beyond Epiroc's control.

The disclosed sustainability matters and key figures are based on the double materiality assessment conducted during 2023 and 2024.
The sustainability statement has been prepared on a consolidated basis covering our own operations as well as upstream and downstream value chain.
To identify and assess Epiroc's indirect impact and risks in operations outside of our direct control such as those performed by customers or business partners we conduct activities like value chain carbon footprint analysis and map ping suppliers’ and customers’ geographical locations using a third party risk tool.
The tool covers various risks including labor standards modern slavery and water stress.
Sustain ability areas where impacts risks and opportunities (IROs) have been identified in the up and/or downstream value chain include areas such as climate change mitigation and workers.
Material identified IROs include CO2e emissions and working conditions.
Read more under the section Double materiality assessment.
The environmental reporting scope covers 85% based on headcount of the Group.
All product companies (PCs) distribution centers (DCs) and technology centers (TCs) are required by the Group to report environmental data for 2024.
All customer centers (CCs) are evaluated based on different factors including the number of employees to decide if they need to report environmental data or not.
For 2024 25 CCs are required to report environmental data.
PCs DCs and TCs report data from significant suppliers.
All entities report data on indirect sales channels (see ESRS 2).
All companies with Epiroc employees or external work force (see ESRS S1) are required to report people manage ment data such as employee numbers safety and health data performance indicators gender diversity and employ ment classification.
Where estimates are present this is clearly stated in each relevant section of the report.
In 2025 we plan to extend our use of estimates where data is missing.
When we integrate newly acquired entities we conduct follow up activities to ensure smooth integration.
All acquired companies are required to report their people management data the first month after closing.
For environmental data we focus on those entities with significant impact assessing each case individually based on their size and expected envi ronmental footprint.
These acquisitions are required to report environmental data in accordance with Epiroc format during the next upcoming quarter and at the latest during the last quarter of the current year.
The reported data should cover the period they have been part of the Group.
11 new acquired entities are reporting environmental data in 2024.


<!-- PAGE: 76 -->
The report covers Epiroc's operations and part of the value chain for the 2024 financial year (1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024) unless otherwise stated.
For own opera tions the entities in scope are companies under Epiroc's operational control which are those that Epiroc AB as the ultimate parent company either directly or indirectly owns.
At year end 2024 the number of subsidiaries was 197 (180) and the number of associated companies was 3 (4).

The reporting meets the requirements of Sweden's legis lation on sustainability reporting as per Chapter 6 paragraph 11 of the Annual Accounts Act before 1 July 2024.

The report comprises pages 38-41 and 74-147.

## Policies for climate change mitigation
### With reference to

E1-2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Epiroc's Sustainability Policy outlines our role in society and our commitment to contributing to the sustainable development of society considering both people and the planet.
It states that we

In 2020 we set ambitious long term climate goals to halve emissions from operations transport products sold and suppliers in 2030 compared with the 2019 base year.

Failing to achieve these goals can harm Epiroc's reputation and negatively impact investors’ and other stakeholders’ view of us as a company.
To address this risk we continue taking actions tracking our progress and maintaining transparent reporting to stakeholders.
If this risk materializes it will necessitate a strategic realignment with a heightened prioritization of our emission reduction efforts.

operations and throughout our value chain.
By doing so we indirectly address the risk of not meeting our 2030 climate goals.
This policy addresses our climate related transition risks related to product and solution offering to customers.

The policy applies to all employees within the Epiroc Group and governs our work in our whole value chain.
It is implemented throughout the whole organization.
Operational responsibility of each divisional President General Manager and Managers in the Group includes all sustainability aspects as well as communication and implementation of the policy and its spirit.
They are responsible for ensuring adherence to the policy in planning processes strategy training targets and performance.

- • Support and are committed to helping accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals,

- • Develop products and services to meet sustainability requirements,

- • Use a lifecycle approach to minimize environmental impacts, including climate impact, that our products and services may have when developed, distributed and used, as well as during end-of-life treatment,

- • Reduce our climate-related impacts by continuously developing our processes, including collaborating with our stakeholders to find solutions for global sustainability challenges,

- • Ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who works with and for us, and • Ensure that we manage our business and sustainability agenda in a legal, efficient and effective way and that we are certified according to ISO 14001. It is reviewed regularly by VP Sustainability and Head of Group SHEQ, and approved by the President and CEO. It is available for all internal stakeholders in the Epiroc Way, referred to in sustainability training, and a poster of it is displayed in each Epiroc facility. External stakeholders can access the policy on our website, www.epirocgroup.com/en/ sustainability.

Epiroc Environmental Principles describe how we should act in relation to environmental material topics.
They include principles to actively work to reduce our climate related impacts by implementing strategies and activities to reduce CO2e emissions from products operations suppliers and transport to reach our 2030 sustainability goals.
The material risk of not achieving our 2030 climate goals is clearly addressed.

The policy defines how we should approach multiple sustainability matters covering all material topics either directly or by referring to our Code of Conduct and Business Partner Code of Conduct (see ESRS S2 and G1).
It guides us in reducing our climate related impacts both in our own The principles address our climate related transition risks related to product and solution offerings to customers stating that new products and technologies are developed and introduced to minimize climate related impacts among other environmental impacts.
The principles state that we actively choose materials and suppliers that contribute to minimum climate change and that we convert to renewable energy in our own operations.


<!-- PAGE: 94 -->
As an ISO 14001 certified company we have defined our Environmental Principles based on the ISO standard as well as other internal and external requirements.
The principles apply to all employees and govern all our work regardless of location or position within our value chain.
Operational responsibility of each divisional President General Manager and Managers in the Group includes all aspects of the principles as well as their communication and implementation.
The principles are reviewed regularly by Head of Group SHEQ and approved by SHEQ Council.
They are available for all internal stakeholders in the Epiroc Way.
Epiroc's Business Partner Code of Conduct (read more in ESRS S2) covers climate related impacts from business partners.
It specifies that our business partners must strive to choose fossil free energy sources for their facilities and if a business partner is particularly requested by Epiroc have a plan in place for reducing their CO2e emissions.
They must control and implement actions to reduce CO2e emissions to air if relevant.
Our business partners shall confirm their commitment to the development and promotion of environmentally friendly technologies in products processes and design.

Our Responsible Use of Resources Policy (read more in ESRS E5) ensures that products and materials utilized by Epiroc are considered valuable resources and remain in the ecosystem at their highest possible resource value.
It states that it is crucial that circularity and waste prevention are considered throughout the lifecycle of a product.
Responsible use of resources also indirectly results in climate related impacts.

Our CO2e Emissions Reduction Hierarchy presents the principles of prioritization when taking CO2e emissions reduction measures.
The objective of the policy is to support employees in establishing efficient plans for emission reduction activities and help them understand what actions to prioritize in reducing CO2e emissions from our operations.
The highest priority is placed on avoidance with reduction and replacement next in the order of priority.
The policy also states what measures are not permitted since they are not approved by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
This policy addresses our climate related impacts as well as our risk of not achieving our 2030 climate goals.
The policy covers reduction activities in our full value chain and General Managers and Process owners are responsible for applying the reduction hierarchy.
It is reviewed regularly by VP Sustainability and is available for all internal stakeholders in the Epiroc Way.

production of solar power.
Energy initiatives completed in 2024 will generate additional CO2e reductions in coming years.
However by including the new reporting units in 2024 CO2e emissions from on site energy consumption have increased by 13% (8) mainly explained by acquisition of new companies.
All major acquired companies will be included in our energy efficiency program and activities will be put in place to ensure we will reach our long term targets.

##### Transport (categories 4 & 9)

The calculation of CO2e emissions of transportation includes upstream and downstream third party transports throughout the supply chain from first tier supplier to end customer.
Third party transports include transports in vehicles not owned or controlled by the Epiroc Group.
All production facilities distribution centers and major emitting customer centers are included.
WTW (Well-To-Wheel) CO2e emissions from the forwarders are collected.
If this data is not available calculation of CO2e emissions is performed using an internal calculation tool applying a distance based method.
For biofuels a fuel based method has been mainly used.
For transport CO2e (categories 3.4 & 3.9) when CO2e emissions are not provided by transport companies emission factors from Network for Transport measures (NTM) are used (www.transportmeasures. org).

## Policies for workers in the value chain

With reference to S2-1 Policies related to value chain workers For managing negative impacts on workers in our upstream value chain Epiroc has three key documents Code of Conduct Business Partner Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Due Diligence Framework.
For workers downstream in our value chain we make use of our Business Partner Code of Conduct our RSA Policy and other steering documents for product safety see ESRS S4.

Our Code of Conduct (CoC) (read more under ESRS G1) describes how we strive to be a good and reliable corporate citizen.
We support all internationally recognized human rights and respect those rights in conducting our operations throughout the world.
We are committed to implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights throughout our business operations.

Epiroc's Business Partner Code of Conduct (BP CoC) outlines requirements for business partners based on applicable laws and internationally recognized principles for how companies should conduct business responsibly.
Further it outlines the appropriate business conduct and expected behaviors defining Epiroc's general approach to respecting human and labor rights.
Epiroc promotes equal opportunities diversity and inclusion and aims to provide a respectful safe and healthy working environment.
The BP CoC also affirms Epiroc's commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen and implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
It defines how we should approach multiple sustainability matters and relates to material IROs identified under ESRS E1 E2 E3 S2 S3 and G1.

Epiroc is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and the BP CoC is based on the following internationally recognized standards

- • UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,

- • UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

- • The International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and subsequent core conventions,

- • UN Convention against Corruption,

- • OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and

- • The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.

Business partners must in all their activities follow the national laws and regulations applicable to their operations in the countries in which they operate.
Should the business partner consider any requirement in the BP CoC to be in conflict with national laws or regulations in a country or territory where they operate the business partner must before signing this document notify Epiroc to discuss how Epiroc's requirements can be accommodated without conflicting with such laws or regulations.
Epiroc's requirements may go beyond the requirements set out in national law in which case the business partner must comply with the stricter Epiroc requirements.

The BP CoC specifies the first step in Epiroc's due diligence process for managing potential negative impacts for workers in the value chain upstream and for indirect sales channels downstream by providing clarity on Epiroc's policy commitments and requirements.
Among other things our business partners must

- • Prohibit all kinds of discrimination.

- • Respect employees’ rights to freedom of association. Safeguard safety by guaranteeing appropriate processes and procedures.


<!-- PAGE: 126 -->
•Under no circumstances use child labor or modern slavery including forced labor or human trafficking.
The policy prohibits activities that could lead to forced labor such as requiring employees to lodge money identity papers or original documents with the business partner and charging employees for personal protective equipment or uniforms.

- • Comply with regulations in respect of working hours.

- • Perform due diligence according to UNGP and OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises when dealing with conflict minerals.

Our definition of business partners includes suppliers distributors contractors working on behalf of Epiroc and intermediaries.
Intermediaries are persons or organizations appointed and paid by Epiroc to represent Epiroc in a particular matter.
They may for example be agents consultants representatives and brokers.

The BP CoC is reviewed regularly by VP Sustainability and VP Group Compliance Officer and approved by the President and CEO.
It is available in 13 languages and is published on our corporate website and communicated to our business partners.
Epiroc's Responsible Sourcing Due Diligence Framework (DD Framework) is designed to identify assess and manage both actual and potential material impacts on value chain workers upstream including service providers like cleaners and security personnel as well as factory workers in our supply chain.
The document states that Epiroc understands the potential negative impacts on human and labor rights that may exist within our upstream value chain and has thus adopted a due diligence approach to manage these impacts.

The primary goal of the DD Framework is to consolidate and enhance Epiroc's efforts in identifying and reducing harm to workers and the environment within the supply chain.
It focuses on human rights and labor rights including forced labor child labor human trafficking health and safety working hours wages freedom of association.
The framework addresses material IROs as identified under ESRS S2.
Epiroc's commitment to human and labor rights is elaborated in the BP CoC.

Epiroc's Responsible Sourcing Manager is responsible for the DD Framework.
The framework is reviewed and approved by VP Strategic Sourcing.
It is a steering document within Epiroc's man agement system and is available for employees in the Epiroc Way.
Epiroc's Conflict Minerals Policy aims to ensure that exploitation and trade of the 3TG content in Epiroc products does not originate from sources that support finance to armed groups or security forces in resource rich areas.
The policy applies to significant suppliers.
Suppliers of products containing 3TG are therefore required to identify and declare the origin of such minerals in the products and components sold to Epiroc to ensure that the products are conflict free and do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in for example the DRC.

Divisional Presidents and General Managers are responsible for the implementation of this policy and are assigned responsibility to oversee the supply chain due diligences process.
The policy is reviewed regularly by Group SHEQ and approved by VP Sustainability.
It is available for all internal stakeholders in the Epiroc Way.
External stakeholders can access the policy on our website.
Epiroc's Responsible Sales Assessment (RSA) Policy aims to enhance our understanding of customers and identify potential risks with regards to human rights corruption and environment in markets where Epiroc is present and find mitigation measures for these potential risks.
The policy supports our CoC commitment to support all internationally recognized human rights and respect those rights in conducting Epiroc's operations throughout the world.
It addresses identified material IROs for downstream value chain workers.

The policy outlines how to implement our RSA process which requires our customer centers to identify and mitigate potential risks.
Specific criteria allow us to determine when the process is required.
These are

- • Country: our third-party risk analytics firm ranks countries according to risks, such as labor standards, child labor, modern slavery, impacts on land rights and indigenous people, environment as well as corruption.

- • Customer: type of customer and project.

Epiroc does not enter into a business relationship if severe risks are identified during the assessment or terminates it if reported later on.

The responsibility for implementing the RSA Policy rests with the divisional Presidents and General Managers for customer centers while VP Sustainability is responsible for updating the policy and communicating any changes.
The Marketing Council is responsible for following up the implementation of the policy.
E-learning training for the RSA Policy and process is available.

All policies documents and processes for how Epiroc conducts business are available on the intranet in the Epiroc Way which all employees have access to.

## Policies for own workforce
### With reference to

##### Performance based employee stock option plan 2024
##### Performance based employee stock option plan 2017-2023

Employees in Epiroc have prior to 2018 been offered to participate in certain share based payment programs offered by Atlas Copco. At the time when the Epiroc shares were listed Atlas Copco had four programs in place 2014-2017 in which certain Epiroc employ ees were participants. The performance based employee stock option plans in Atlas Copco were in accordance with their terms split between Atlas Copco and Epiroc in connection with the distribution and listing of Epiroc on Nasdaq Stockholm. In April 2024 the last plan origined from Atlas Copco was ended. Approximately 300 key employees of Epiroc have received under the performance based stock option plan for the years 2018-2023 options related to Epiroc and receive incentives related to the perfor mance of Epiroc. The terms and conditions of the performance based employee stock option plans for the years 2018-2023 are in all mate rial aspects similar to the terms and conditions of the performance based employee stock option plan for 2024 in Epiroc as described below. The Annual General Meeting of Epiroc held on May 14 2024 resolved based on a proposal from the Board of Directors to introduce a performance based employee stock option plan for 2024 which is similar in structure to the previous stock option plans approved by the Annual General Meeting. The performance based employee stock option plan is directed at a maximum of 140 key employees in Epiroc who will have the pos sibility to acquire a maximum of 1 827 359 Class A shares in Epiroc. The issuing of options depends on the value increase expressed as Economic Value Added of Epiroc during 2024. In an interval of SEK 1 200 000 000 the issue varies linearly from zero to 100% of the maximum number of options. The participating key employees are divided into different categories with different amounts of maximum issues of options depending on their positions. The issuing of options will take place no later than March 20 2025. The term of the options is seven years from granting and the options are exercisable not ear lier than three years from grant date. The exercise price shall be set at an amount corresponding to 110% of the average of the closing rates on Nasdaq Stockholm of Epiroc's Class A shares during a period of ten business days following the date of the publishing of the Interim report Q4 2024. A participant must still be employed in order to exer cise their options. The options are not transferable. The costs of the performance based employee stock option plan will on an on going basis during the term of the plan be reported in accordance with IFRS 2 and is estimated to amount up to approxi mately 0. The estimated costs for advice and administration linked to the program are approximately 3.5. In order to limit the exposure of the performance based employee stock option plan hedging mea sures have been adopted in the form of share buy backs (see note 21) which can be transferred to the participants of the plan pursuant to resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting of Epiroc. A prerequisite for the participation of senior executives (11 partic ipants) in the performance based employee stock option plan is an investment of a maximum of ten percent of the participants’ respec tive base salary for 2024 before tax in series A shares of Epiroc. The investments may be made in cash or by payment of shares however not by shares that are obtained as a part of the performance based employee stock option plans for 2022 2023. Senior executives who have invested in Epiroc series A shares as a part of the employee stock option plan in addition to the proportional participation in the plan for each share acquired have a right (a “matching option”) to acquire a share three years after the grant until the expiration of the employee stock option plan 2024 at a price equal to 75% of the market value upon which the exercise price of the shares in the 2024 employee stock option plan was based subject to continued employment and continued ownership of the shares. For all the programs 2018-2024 a total maximum of 4 001 863 shares could be delivered to employees corresponding to approxi mately 0.3% of the total number of shares in Epiroc. The Board of Epiroc has the right to decide to implement an alter native incentive solution (SARs) for key persons in such countries where the grant of employee stock options is not feasible. In the 2018-2019 programs at the request of optionees it has been possi ble to settle the options by the Company's paying cash equal to the excess of the closing price of the shares over the exercise price on the exercise day less any administrative fees. Due to this choice of settlement by the Swedish employees these options were classified for accounting purposes as cash settled in accordance with IFRS 2. As of October 2020 this possibility was removed from the terms and therefore only those options in the 2016-2017 plans are accounted for as cash settled if the participant has opted for this possibility. For the plans 2018 and onwards no options are accounted for as cash settled. The Black Scholes model is used to calculate the fair value of the options/SARs in the programs at issue date. For the programs in 2024 the fair value of the options/SARs was based on the following assumptions

Opportunity Downstream Short term Medium term Long term

While access to renewable electricity and fuels is currently a challenge for customers in some countries we expect this to become less challenging over the long term.
We collaborate with customers to understand and support their infrastructure needs including providing training to share knowledge and best practices.
We develop tailor made solutions for customers facing electricity supply challenges particularly for their electric infrastructure and optimizing energy management for battery electric vehicles.
In the long term customers’ ambitious CO2e reduction targets will likely expand their focus to Scope 3 on their path to reaching net zero.
This will increase the demand for capital equipment with lower embodied emissions.
Embodied emissions are the total GHG emissions associated with various stages of a product's lifecycle excluding the operational use.
Successful climate mitigation with product offerings of lower embodied emissions can position Epiroc as a preferred supplier driving market growth and new business opportunities.
Our 2030 climate target to halve CO2e emissions from relevant suppliers and the transition plan for achieving this are contributing to lowering the embodied emissions in our products.

The transition to a low carbon economy requires sustainable infrastructure and electrification which in turn drives the demand for minerals like copper zinc and nickel which are essential for electrification technologies.
Our customers in the mining industry play a vital role in supplying these metals and minerals and our products and services help extract them.
By capitalizing on this transition there is a potential for higher sales volumes.
