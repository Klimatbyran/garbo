Scope 1

Scope 1 emissions are generated by our vehicle fleet, which includes service vehicles and company cars for private use, in cases where Coor pays for the fuel, as well as our machinery. The transition to an electrified vehicle fleet has begun. There are challenges regarding access to charging infrastructure and delivery times for electric vehicles.

Scope 1 and 2 - tCO 2 e from vehicle fleet and premises

<!-- image -->

Scopes 1-3

Scope 1 encompasses all direct GHG emissions. For Coor, this includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels from vehicles and machinery.

Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from energy consumption in the form of electricity, heating and cooling.

Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, capital goods, investments, employee commuting, waste disposal, upstream transportation and distribution.

Scope 2 GHG emissions

Emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents from electricity, heating and cooling in premises where Coor has operational control over its energy consumption, in absolute values (tCO 2 e).

Emissions

Coor's operations give rise to direct GHG emissions from our vehicle fleet and machinery (Scope 1), indirect emissions from energy consumption in the form of electricity, heating and cooling (Scope 2) and emissions that occur in our value chain where Coor does not always own the process or have direct control over production (Scope 3). These include purchased goods and services, business trips and employee commuting to and from work. Our goal is to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 compared with our baseline year 2018.

Definitions
Scope 1 GHG emissions

Emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents from purchased fuel for owned and leased machinery and vehicles are reported in absolute values (tCO 2 e).

Result -28%

Overall, Coor's Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased by 28 per cent in absolute terms since 2018. The trend is positive, but not sufficient to achieve our target for 2030. The 2025 interim target will also be challenging, due to the company's rapid growth, which is resulting in a growing car fleet. The decrease during the year was driven by a higher proportion of electric vehicles, with orders for electric vehicles that were previously delayed now starting to be delivered, as well as both increased HVO fuel use and a higher proportion of renewable electricity in our premises.

Scope 3 GHG emissions - food and beverages

Emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents from purchased foods included in the food and beverages service delivery (kg CO 2 e/kg purchased foods).

Scope 2

Scope 2 comprises energy consumption in the form of electricity, heating and cooling in the premises where Coor has operational control over energy consumption. Energy is consumed mainly in the form of electricity and heat. District heating is the principal form of heating. Energy reviews are carried out annually.

Coor works continuously to reduce energy consumption in its premises and to ensure that renewable energy sources are used where possible.

Scope 3 supply chain GHG emissions

The sum of emissions from suppliers with SBTs (for the reporting year) divided by the sum of emissions from purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution (for the reporting year).

Environmental responsibility
Reduced emissions Scope 1 and 2
Supplier engagement Scope 3
Target -75% by 2030

Coor's target is to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 compared with the base year, 2018. The interim target is to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2025.

Data, emission factors and methodology

Coor calculates GHG emissions according to the GHG Protocol. Coor's Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated using activity data and account for 3 per cent of our total emissions. The remaining 97 per cent are Scope 3 emissions, of which one third are calculated using activity data and two thirds using a spend-based method. We regularly review our emission factors to take into account the best available data for our products and services. We last updated our emission factors in 2023. The update that was done in 2023 affects the entirety of our emissions through an increase of 38 per cent compared with the same purchased volumes during the same time period calculated with the previous emission factors. The biggest differences are in the service areas workplace services - specifically coffee-related services - and in property and security.

Scope 3

Of Coor's emissions calculated in the base year 2018, 3 per cent of greenhouse gases came directly from our operations (Scope 1 and 2). The vast majority of Coor's GHG emissions are indirect Scope 3 emissions, arising from purchased goods and services linked to our service delivery to the customer.

We have targets and developed processes for monitoring some of our indirect Scope 3 emissions. For food and beverages, we are aiming to reduce kg CO 2 e/kg by 30 per cent by 2025, from the base year 2018.

In Scope 3, we have a further target that is related to our supply chain. The target is for 75 per cent

Targets, results and KPIs 1)
Targets and results

In the near term, by 2026, we are aiming to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared with in the base year 2018. In the medium term, by 2030, we are targeting a 75 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The status for 2024 is a reduction of 28 per cent.

In 2024, 79 per cent of the electricity came from renewable sources, compared with 77 per cent in 2023. An important part of this work is to continue the transition to renewable electricity.

Another, near-term target is to ensure that 75 per cent of our suppliers in terms of emissions have targets in line with the Paris Agreement. In 2024, the figure was 30 per cent.

In the medium term, by 2030, we are targeting a 58 per cent reduction in emissions from food and beverages. In 2024, these emissions had been reduced by 16 per cent (2.23 kg CO 2 e/kg) compared with the base year 2018 (2.66 kg CO 2 e/kg).

1)   During the year, we improved the matching of food products with the RISE Food Climate Database, which resulted in higher emissions for Denmark. Denmark accounts for 46 per cent of emissions from food and beverages, which means that this also has an impact on the outcome for the Group as a whole. In 2025, we will update the target in absolute terms in connection with a base year update, but with an unchanged ambition regarding the pace of reduction.

Tools to support our customers

Coor currently has two tools - Envirosense and Carbon Insight - to facilitate increased demand from our customers for climate-smart service solutions. With these tools, Coor can identify the key drivers of emissions, both in Coor's service delivery to the customer and in the customer's own emission categories where Coor can also help to reduce emissions. Through these tools, we ensure demand in our customer base for innovative solutions, increased circularity in material flows and circular business models, which in turn increases the chances of finding value-creating partnerships in the value chain.

1)   The base year for Coor's climate calculations is 2018. Scope 1 emissions are calculated based on purchased volume of fuel and fuel type and are multiplied by emission factors for each fuel type. The consolidation method is operational control. Emission factors from DEFRA as well as supplier-specific ones. A full year is considered as rolling 12 months; December 2023-November 2024. Gas included in the calculation is CO 2. . Other gases not included are CH₄, N₂O, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ and NF₃.

2)   The base year for Coor's climate calculations is 2018. The consolidation method is operational control. Location-based is not included in the total in the table above. Emission factors from DEFRA, Sthlm Exergi, Energiföretagen, Vattenfall, AIB, IEA. A full year is considered as rolling 12 months; December 2023- November 2024. Gas included in the calculation is CO 2. . Other gases not included are CH₄, N₂O, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ and NF₃.

3)   The base year for Coor's climate calculations is 2018. Coor calculates its carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Emission factors for food and beverages have been taken from the RISE Food Climate Database. Spend-based emission factors are based on the emission factor database of the Swedish National Agency for Public Procurement and the methodology developed together with climate experts. A full year is considered as rolling 12 months; December 2023November 2024.

4)   The methodology for calculating water use varies between years. Factors such as expanded operations and the number of employees at the offices also affect the values.

5)   Purchased transportation and distribution, higher values for 2023 are attributed to the inclusion of refrigerated transport in the calculation methodology.

- 6)   Use of sold products is a new category for Coor in the 2024 report. Processing of sold products has previously been reported in the category use of sold products.
- 7)   The increase in Scope 1 biogenic emissions is due to a continued increase in the share of HVO.

Data-driven analysis tool for climate data

Coor has worked systematically to map and calculate its climate impact since 2018, which is our base year for climate calculations, and it is from 2018 that we have had the best available data. In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of our total GHG emissions (in tCO₂eq) to get a full picture of the climate impact of our operations, including raw material consumption. As part of this work, we developed a tool to improve our emission calculations, which we call Emission Navigator. The tool went live in 2022 and is continuously being developed to further validate data and automate processes, with the aim of gradually increasing the share of activitybased data in the calculations.

Emission Navigator focuses not only on Scope 1 and 2, but also on three main service areas that account for the largest share of our emissions: food and beverages, property services and cleaning. To strengthen this effort, we have established partnerships with leading experts in life cycle analysis and climate impact calculation. The tool enables comprehensive measurement of GHG emissions from operations and raw material consumption, and also includes a visualisation tool that supports data-driven decisions to reduce Coor's climate impact. The calculation of emissions from food and beverages is based on detailed supplier data supplemented by climate scores from a specialised food climate database. The database is based on life cycle analyses of over 750 food categories and contains more than 1,500 unique climate scores. This approach allows us to gain a deeper understanding of our emissions and provides valuable support in our efforts to reduce our climate impact.

Key performance indicators

Our long-term target is net zero emissions for all three scopes by 2040.

Furthermore, through measures such as climate-smart menu planning Coor has reduced emissions in food and beverages by 16 per cent compared with the baseline year 2018, and reports a value of 2.23 kg CO 2 e/kg food purchased for the year 2024. The increase compared with last year is primarily due to updated emission factors. For further information, see our sustainability statement.

Strategy and action plan 1)
Science-based targets

Coor has science-based targets for emission reductions in Scope 1, 2 and 3.

In the near term, by 2026, we are aiming to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared with in the base year 2018. We are also aiming to ensure that 75 per cent of our suppliers in terms of emissions have targets in line with the Paris Agreement.

In the medium term, by 2030, we are targeting a 75 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 58 per cent reduction in emissions from food and beverages.

From a financial perspective, potential climate change could pose risks linked to increased costs in the form of emissions charges, taxes and product shortages, which could lead to higher costs and lower margins. Supply chain disruptions can also pose a risk.

The company has also identified opportunities to strengthen its market position by offering customers climate-friendly and resource-efficient services. Demand for such solutions can help to reduce risks and create new business opportunities.

To ensure systematic, high-quality environmental management throughout the company, both internally and in Coor's efforts to improve its customers' environmental management, the company has introduced a mandatory basic environmental training course which all employees are required to complete during their first year of employment.

By applying the precautionary principle, Coor encourages a responsible and preventive approach in all its areas of activity.

Read more about our material matters and the process for this assessment in the section Material matters.

These targets are designed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the Paris Agreement. These targets drive innovation and demonstrate Coor's long-term commitment to sustainability for our employees, customers and investors. Coor's near-term and long-term targets have been set through an analysis centred on growth scenarios, and where possible changes to the operations have been taken into account. These targets are integrated into Coor's business model and long-term strategy.

Other find business models that lead towards circularity, in relation to customers as well as suppliers.

For Coor, increased circularity in the value chain has three components:

- How the service that Coor delivers can be replaced by something that generates lower emissions while creating the same value.
- How our services can be delivered with fewer resources.
- Whether the resources used in the services can be switched to more environmentally friendly alternatives.

Coor is now conducting a review of its service portfolio based on this analysis. Supplier partnerships will be crucial in this work going forward. Circular business models are about finding ways to remain profitable while moving towards an increasingly circular business. Here, Coor generally has an advantage as a service provider, although there are areas of the business that will need to change.

In addition to investing in an electric vehicle fleet, renewable energy and innovative solutions for circular material flows and business models, Coor is developing a comprehensive strategy to integrate carbon credits into our long-term plans. We are actively exploring carbon credit programmes, designing a carbon removal strategy and evaluating various carbon offset projects and potential partnerships that are in line with our validated science-based and net zero targets. By planning for investments in high-quality carbon credits, we aim to further enhance our efforts to achieve net zero emissions. High-quality carbon credits are defined as removals and permanent storage. We are also assessing other options that generate additional value, such as biodiversity conservation or enhancement.

Investments (CapEx)

Total CapEx includes acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, as well as new right-of-use assets for the year. See Note 10 Intangible assets, Note 11 Property, plant and equipment, and Note 12 Leases. Assets identified as part of a business combination (excluding goodwill) are also included in the amount of total investments.

Eligible CapEx consists of investments in the 2024 financial year from suppliers with Taxonomy-eligible activities.

During the year, Coor signed leases for cars (CCM 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) and commercial premises (CCM 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings). Otherwise, no proportion of the Group's investments is linked to Taxonomyeligible activities.

Purchases from suppliers can only be assessed as Taxonomy-aligned if it has been possible to verify that the supplier has conducted Taxonomyaligned activities. To determine that the economic activity is Taxonomy-aligned, Coor must ensure that the technical screening criteria for making a substantial contribution and doing no significant harm to the other environmental objectives have been met. Moreover, the supplier must have all processes for minimum safeguards in place.

Coor has signed a lease for new premises for its head office, with occupancy scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Coor gained access to a small part of the premises which is reported as an investment in 2024. According to the property owner, the property is certified according to BREEAM-SE v.6, level Outstanding, and has an estimated energy consumption of 50 percent below the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning's recommended level. The property owner describes in its sustainability report that climate risk analyses are carried out on all properties and that the requirements for minimum safeguards are in place. An assessment has been made that the property meets the criteria for Taxonomy alignment and the investment in 2024 is thus reported as aligned.

For other investments, Coor have not been able to verify with certainty that the suppliers' activities meet all criteria and therefore reports all these investments as eligble but not taxonomy-aligned. Coor works with these processes to ensure that in the future it will be possible to verify this.

Of new car leases, 85 per cent refers to cars that meet the technical screening criteria of maximum emissions of 50g CO 2 /km. Coor's goal is to replace all cars with electric cars over time.

Reduced climate impact

<!-- image -->

Coor offers several services that help customers reduce the climate impact of their workplace. Envirosense brings together our range of services for helping customers achieve their climate targets. Envirosense highlights possible behavioural changes, actions and their potential impacts in seven key areas. Coor has also launched the Carbon Insight tool, which gives customers an overview of how emissions are distributed across different services and their sub-categories linked to Coor's FM delivery. The tool thus provides valuable insights into how Coor's services can contribute to reducing their climate impact.

Governance

In governance, Coor's Chief Legal Counsel and Compliance Officer have a central responsibility to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to support the Board of Directors and Executive Management Team in maintaining good governance and transparency in the organisation. The Chief Legal Counsel is part of the Executive Management Team.

Customer relationships and customer satisfaction are key elements of Coor's business model, which is governed by clear processes for how to effectively manage and respond to feedback from customers. Each business unit in the Group has dedicated contact persons who ensure that feedback reaches the right contract and that tools for analysis and follow-up of customer surveys are available.

Coor's compliance work is led by the company's Compliance Officer, and regularly involves the Executive Management Team, including the CEO and CFO, as well as the management teams of our country organisations. The Compliance Forum is intended to serve as a platform for discussion and collaboration to ensure that the company complies with all applicable laws and standards as well as to manage risks related to non-compliance. Its purpose is to promote awareness, training and dialogue on the company's compliance issues and ensure that the company's operations are conducted in an ethical manner and in compliance with legal requirements.

Information security is managed by our Information Security Management Council, with executive representation from the company's executive management, and representation from the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Head of IT Security and Data Protection Officer (DPO) roles.

Business responsibility in the supply chain is governed by clear requirements and guidelines for suppliers and subcontractors. These requirements cover health and safety, human rights and social responsibility.

Policy and Code of Conduct for responsible procurement

To ensure responsible procurement, we have a Group-wide Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct. The Code describes Coor's basic ethical principles and the minimum standards our suppliers are required to adhere to, even when these exceed the requirements of local laws. For example, suppliers are required to comply with the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of the UN Global Compact, and to share our zero tolerance approach to child labour and bribery. We monitor our suppliers' compliance with the Code through audits.

Impacts, risks and opportunities

Climate and energy is considered to be a material matter for Coor from both an impact materiality and a financial materiality perspective. Coor's services result in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, which include supplier transport, material processing and energy consumption in the Group's operations and service delivery, including emissions from company-owned vehicles. The area that has the greatest environmental impact for Coor in terms of emission volumes is purchased goods and services, in Scope 3.

Our long-term target is net zero emissions for all three scopes by 2040.

Circular and decarbonised offerings

Coor needs to drive sales towards services that are more circular and generate lower CO 2 emissions. Net zero needs to underpin Coor's entire service portfolio and how we work with both customers and suppliers.

Our new concepts are important keys to increasing sales of circular and decarbonised services.

'Coor already offers several such services, and going forward our task will be to adapt our entire service portfolio and build demand for these types of services,' explains Kajsa Bårman, Sustainability Strategist at Coor.

With more and more of Coor's customers demanding FM services with a low carbon footprint, Coor launched two new concepts in 2024 that are expected to further boost demand. Carbon Insight provides a detailed picture of CO 2 emissions linked to Coor's delivery. Envirosense includes all emissions linked to the customer's workplace, such as commuting to and from the workplace and office waste. This enables a shared understanding with the customer of where the emissions come from and what generates high and low emissions.

'Our new concepts are an important key to increasing sales of circular and decarbonised services. They enable transparency and allow us to examine together how we can develop Coor's services to create value for the customer while also reducing emissions,' says Kajsa Bårman.

Reporting principles

Coor reports in accordance with the GHG Protocol and reports energy consumption for buildings where Coor has operational control over the energy consumption. Energy consumption is based on actual consumption where possible. In buildings where it was not possible to collect actual energy consumption data, the figure has been estimated based on energy consumption for an equivalent operation in Coor in the same national market, on a per square metre basis.
