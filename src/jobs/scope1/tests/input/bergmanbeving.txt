Climate calculations

These calculations are based on calendar year data and exclude acquisitions during the year. Ateco, Elkington, Itaab, Orbital, Sandbergs and Tema were acquired last year and are the newest companies included in the Group's climate calculations. Maskinab, Spraylat, Levypinta, Ovesta, Collinder and Labsense were acquired during the year but will not be included in the Group's climate calculations until next year.

- New companies that are currently included in the Group's climate calculations increased the amount of purchased energy by 1,021 MWh. Excluding these new companies, the Group's purchased energy decreased 12 percent.
- Energy consumption per Swedish krona in revenue decreased during the year as a result of focused energy savings measures at several of the Group's companies, primarily at our production units. New companies that are currently included in the Group's climate calculations are more energy-intensive.
- New companies that are currently included in the Group's climate calculations increased the number of kilometres driven by company car to 3,910 kilometres. Nonetheless, there was a decrease of CO2e per kilometre driven since the share of kilometres driven by electric vehicle increased and the share of kilometres driven by cars using fossil fuels declined.

Emissions and energy consumption
Activities and progress during the year

The project focused on reporting and monitoring emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 categories upstream and downstream in the Group's value chain - continued during the year and the target was achieved for the Group's large units. This is the first step before the smaller units are included in the reporting, and Bergman &amp; Beving intends to report material categories within Scope 3, in addition to Scopes 1 and 2, for the next financial year. This work is also in line with the EU-directive CSRD and the reporting standards ESRS.

By measuring and analysing our emissions and energy consumption first, we can concentrate our resources to where we have the greatest impact and opportunities to improve. When it comes to transportation, Bergman &amp; Beving has opted to minimise air transport and thus mainly uses marine transport between continents. The containers loaded onto the ships should achieve a certain coefficient of fullness in order to be efficient as regards both costs and reducing emissions. The coefficient of fullness is also measured on all transports leaving the Group's logistics centre in Ulricehamn, where deliveries to customers go by truck. The climate footprint of our upstream and downstream transports is included in the project to calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions.

FOCUS AREA

Sustainability initiatives focused where we have the greatest impact

Bergman &amp; Beving's decentralised governance model creates sustainable and profitable growth by developing and acquiring companies managed by passionate entrepreneurs. It is clear that innovation and demand for sustainable products and technological solutions is growing continuously, which creates business opportunities for Bergman &amp; Beving since our companies strive to offer solutions that combine functionality with safety and sustainability.

We are convinced that systematic sustainability work needs to be part of the business strategy at every one of our companies in order to create long-term value. The goal of our strategic sustainability work is to promote business opportunities, attract the best employees, meet the requirements of CSRD and to drive sustainable, profitable growth while reducing our climate impact not only in our own operations but throughout the entire value chain.

It is important for us that each company, in addition to working with the joint Group-wide goals, also identifies its key sustainability matters with associated goals and activities. We consider the combination of Group-wide and company-specific goals to be an important part of our sustainability work. With an emphasis on people, innovation, products and relationships with customers and suppliers, we are continuing on our collective journey to contribute to the ongoing transition. We continuously strive to be the reliable choice for our customers, employees and shareholders.

We completed our double materiality assessment in accordance with the requirements in the CSRD during the year and will continue to further develop our sustainability framework in 2025/2026, for example by making climate calculations in accordance with all three Scopes of the GHG Protocol. At the same time, our companies are carrying out various sustainability initiatives, such as developing Environmental Product Declarations (EPD), expanding ISO certifications and working with product development and our customer offering. Several companies have made energy efficiency improvements, which reduced our climate impact in GHG Scope 2, purchased energy, by several kWh despite our acquisitions during the year. The companies have also worked to measure waste generated by own operations and replaced plastic packaging with paper packaging. Their suppliers have also continued to sign our Code of Conduct. The companies impacted by the upcoming EU steel tariffs are working to meet the requirements of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

We have elected to focus on and prioritise sustainability efforts in the areas where we have the greatest ability to have a positive impact and to make a difference for our stakeholders, work that we will continue with going forward.

Materials, waste and circular flows
Activities and progress during the year

Bergman &amp; Beving works to limit the environmental impact of our operations. We want to increase resource efficiency in order to reduce material consumption, recycle and reuse more materials, and improve circular flows. The performance measure we currently monitor within the Group is consumption of packaging per delivered cubic metre (m³) from our logistics centre, which many of our units have agreements with and use as a logistics partner. The goal is to gradually reduce the use of packaging.

The Group is carrying out a project to measure and monitor more areas across our entire value chain linked to materials, waste and circular flows. In several places, these are included in the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 categories and will be reported in the 2025/2026 financial year in accordance with the new sustainability reporting legislation.

Our impact:

- An indirect impact on the environment, working conditions and human rights in the value chain, which is addressed through regular audits of suppliers.
- An indirect impact through emissions from transportation providers, which is addressed by using marine freight to the greatest possible extent, avoiding air freight and actively choosing transportation providers with a lower climate impact.
- A direct impact through coefficient of fullness for incoming and outgoing goods as well as packaging consumption, which is addressed through measuring and following up on these parameters.

Environmental Policy

Our Environmental Policy, which is part of the Code of Conduct, describes how the Group is to work actively to continuously reduce our direct and indirect environmental impact. According to the Environmental Policy, the Group's activities should be based on circularity and efficient use of natural resources, and important decisions should take environmental impacts into consideration in order to create long-term value for the Group's stakeholders.

FOCUS AREA

Focus areas and goal formulation

Bergman &amp; Beving believes that the Group's sustainability goals, which are structured in a framework with focus areas, are still current and relevant, but will continue to be evaluated in accordance with the CSRD. The focus areas apply across all units within the Group and are described in more detail in the next chapter.

Each company can implement unit-specific goals in addition to these focus areas. The Board monitors sustainability efforts in connection with the annual strategy review. Based on the results of completed stakeholder dialogues and materiality assessments, management's priorities are structured in a framework with six focus areas linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We have goals in all ESG areas environment &amp; climate, social sustainability and governance (Environment, Social and Governance).

Our impact:

- A direct impact on workers' health and safety, with a focus on safe workplaces and good working conditions.
- A direct impact through energy consumption at our premises, which is addressed through energy efficiency actions.

Sustainable value chain

The companies in the Group have worked to increase the share of procurement from certified suppliers, which yielded results during the year. The share of procurement volume from suppliers who have signed our Code of Conduct decreased, however, due to a change in mix and acquisitions.

Coefficients of fullness

- Coefficient of fullness, incoming freight: There was a great deal of turbulence in the maritime market during the year. Reduced allocations from our primary supplier meant that we had to contract alternative suppliers at short notice in order to have any products delivered at all. Nonetheless, we managed to maintain last year's positive coefficient of fullness for incoming freight, and the item structure was stable.
- Coefficient of fullness, outgoing freight: The method for measuring the coefficient for fullness was expanded during the year to include all sent packages that previously lacked data. Regardless of whether the new or old method (50 percent) was used, this performance measure improved during the year through continued, focused work on following up with our customers through regular debriefing meetings. The packing procedures include clear instructions to cut down cartons to minimise the amount of air, and we also have a dialogue with our customers regarding their selection of transportation solution to reduce the amount of air in cartons.

Social sustainability

Bergman &amp; Beving's performance measures related to Employees and Equality &amp; Diversity are presented in the table below.

Sustainability strategy
Stakeholder dialogues and materiality assessments

Bergman &amp; Beving works continuously to prioritise how we can maximise the impact of our sustainability initiatives. To enable targeted efforts and resources, Bergman &amp; Beving's sustainability strategy is based on several materiality assessments, through which we have assessed where we have the greatest impact. The foundation for the Group's sustainability strategy was laid in 2017 when the first stakeholder dialogue and subsequent assessment were carried out. In 2021/2022, another materiality assessment was carried out in the form of stakeholder dialogues, and in 2023-2024, a double materiality assessment was carried out in accordance with the CSRD requirements.

Double materiality assessment in accordance with the CSRD In 2023, Bergman &amp; Beving started to prepare for the new EU directive on sustainability reporting, the CSRD, along with the associated European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), by carrying out a double materiality assessment. Double materiality looks at the outward impact of the operations on people and the environment as well as the inward impact of sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities on the operations. Both perspectives cover our own operations as well as the entire value chain, both upstream and downstream. This allows the double materiality assessment to provide an overview of the areas where Bergman &amp; Beving has the greatest impact and will provide the basis for continued work in sustainability.

The scope of the audit

Our examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR's standard RevR 12 The auditor´s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report. This means that our examination of the statutory sustainability report is substantially different and less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinion.

Sustainability governance

Sustainability is an important part of Bergman &amp; Beving's operations and business model, with sustainability governance integrated into the overall operations as well as the management structure. This means that important decision-making processes across the entire organisation take sustainability matters into consideration.

The Board bears the ultimate responsibility for the sustainability strategy, including setting Group-wide sustainability goals and resolving on policies and the Group-wide Code of Conduct. The Board is also responsible for monitoring the sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities identified in the Group's double materiality assessment. Management breaks down the sustainability goals, priorities work efforts and is responsible for monitoring and evaluating sustainability work. Each business unit establishes its own sustainability goals in addition to the Group-wide goals and conducts its own sustainability initiatives. Employees carry out sustainability initiatives and develop the tools and processes necessary for promoting sustainability in each company.
