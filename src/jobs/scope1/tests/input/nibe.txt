E1-6 Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions

All disclosed GHG emissions are attributable to the consolidated Group (parent and subsidiaries). With the exception of companies acquired during the reporting year there are no investees such as  associates,  jointly  controlled  companies  or  unconsolidated subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated in the Group's financial statements. Neither are there any contractual arrangements that are joint arrangements not structured through an entity for which we have operational  control.  Because  emission  data  is  missing from  the  newly  acquired  companies,  there  is  also  no  separate emission data available for disclosure.

No Scope 1 GHG emissions are from regulated emission trading schemes.

The calculation of our GHG emissions was carried out on accordance with the principles, requirements and guidance in the GHG Protocol4. The emission factors for Scope 1 and 2 are from Swedish Energy Agency Heat values 2024, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency Emission factors 2024, DEFRA (UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting), IEA - International Energy Agency and the cooling and heat pump trade association Svenska  Kyl  &amp;  värmepumpföreningen.  Conversion  factors  were obtained from the Swedish Energy Agency and Energigas.se. We used the most recently published Global Warming Potential (GWP) values,  based  on  a  100-year  time  horizon,  to  calculate  carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) for GHG emissions other than CO2. All companies acquired in the year preceding the reporting period were included in the sustainability reporting.

4 Corporate Standard (version 2004) and GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (version 2011)

Our  Scope  1  biogenic  emissions  come  from  combustion  of bioethanol, biodiesel, pellets and biogas. Biogenic emissions also occur in Scope 2 in connection with production of electricity and district  heating,  but  we  do  not  have  information  on  emissions from district heating. The same applies to our indirect biogenic CO2 emissions under Scope 3. In the coming years, we will take measures  to  enable  disclosure  of  our  biogenic  CO2  emissions under  both  Scope  2  and  Scope  3.  Scope  3  biogenic  emissions mostly occur during the use phase of our sold pellet- or woodfired stove products.

100% of purchased electricity is bundled with instruments in the form of Guarantees of Origin (GoO), International Renewable Energy Certificates (IREC), Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) and  Renewable  Energy  Guarantees  of  Origin  (REGO).  This  electricity accounts for 94% of all purchased electricity under Scope 2. Guarantee of Origins are purchased centrally for the Group as a whole.

Scope 3

We have carried out calculations for our indirect Scope 3 emissions  for  all  categories  Scope  3  GHG  emissions  are  mostly calculated using assumptions and estimates. Of the total of 15 categories, we measured activity data from our Group companies for the following categories:

1 Purchased goods and services

3 Fuel and energy-related activities

- 4 Upstream transportation and distribution
- 5 Waste generated in operations
- 6 Business traveling

For  the  remaining  categories,  estimates  of  activity  data  are made  at  Group  level.  No  calculation  tools  intended  specifically for GHG emission calculations were used to calculate emissions. Of our total Scope 3 GHG emissions, less than 1% relates to primary data received from suppliers or other value chain partners.

The category with the single biggest emissions is category 11 (Use of sold products), which is due to the fact that our products use energy in the form of electricity, wood, gas or pellets during the use phase. The two factors with the biggest impact on these emissions are product service life and the type of energy used. In our calculations, we have assumed an average service life for each product group and that the energy used by our customers refers  to  the  general  energy  mix  in  the  different  countries.  If purchased  electricity  comprises  completely  fossil-free  electricity,  emissions  in  this  category  would  be  substantially  lower. In this category we have assumed total refrigerant leakage of 2% over the entire use phase.

The  category  with  the  second-largest  Scope  3  emissions (significantly lower emissions than in category 11) is category 1 (Purchased goods and services). These are calculated based on the weight of purchased materials and material-specific emission factors. In 2025, we will continue to work on quality assurance of information for the most material categories in Scope 3.

For Scope 3 we use emission factors from Swedenergy (Energiföretagen), the Swedish Energy Agency, IEA, DEFRA, EPDs, the Swedish  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Swedish  Recycling Industries and Swedish Waste Management.

E1-5 Energy consumption and mix

NIBE  is  part  of  the  'Manufacturing'  sector,  which  is  assessed as having significant climate impact according to the EU directive3.  All energy use in NIBE's operations is therefore labeled as energy from high climate impact sectors. NIBE's energy intensity from these sectors amounted to 8.3 in 2024. A reconciliation to the  financial  statements,  Note  4,  is  shown  in  the  table  on  the right. Newly acquired companies in the reporting year have not started energy reporting but have started financial reporting. The reported  energy  intensity  included  only  Group  companies  that were active throughout the financial year and therefore reported their energy use.

Net  revenue  was  audited  in  connection  with  the  financial audit, but energy was not.

2 FTSE LCE ICS™ (Financial Times Stock Exchange Low Carbon Economy Industrial Classification System) is a quantitative model designed to permit investors to assess a company's ability to adapt its business to the requirements related to reduced climate impact. Product groups included in LCE: heat pumps, district heating, boilers, stoves for burning pellets and wood, PV panels, heat exchangers, components for rail, electric and hybrid vehicles, ventilation and building cooling, and renewable energy production.

REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS BY 65%

Our GHG emissions target is aimed at reducing direct (Scope 1) and indirect  (market-based  Scope  2)  GHG  emissions  by  65%  by 2030 compared with the base year 2019. We consider this to be an ambitious target because the cross-sector emission pathway recommended by SBTi requires a reduction of at least 57% in the same  period.  The  target  is  an  absolute  target.  It  has  not  been externally validated and does not include indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions. The GHG emissions are calculated based on adopted emission  factors.  All  six  greenhouse  gases  defined  in  the  GHG protocol  are  included  in  the  report  and  are  converted  into  CO2 equivalents (CO2eq). We carry out base year recalculation in line with the GHG Protocol guidance in order for our annual results to be comparable with the base year. The GHG emission reduction target is a gross target, which means that we do not include GHG removals, carbon credits or avoided emissions. The target is linked to our climate and environment focus areas as well as use of our own energy-efficient products.

We defined the target taking into account future technological developments that will enable us to be more energy-efficient and facilitate the use of renewable fuels. We also took into consideration a number of different climate scenarios, the most important of which was the scenario in which we succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Because our target should be aligned with this scenario, we consider it to be science-based. Our target is in line with  upcoming regulations  from  the  EU,  involving  new  requirements for renewable fuels and the phasing out of fossil fuels.

In 2024 we achieved a reduction of 35% (16,795 metric tons in absolute terms) compared with the base year 2019. The reduction was the result of implemented investments in e.g. the vehicle fleet, work on phasing out fossil fuels and the implementation of new climate control systems. Many of the investments have been carried out in connection with energy mapping. The reduction in GHG emissions is also  the  result  of  the  transition  to  renewable electricity in acquired companies, increased energy efficiency in existing  operations and changes to processes. To some extent, the reduction in emissions was also due to new technology and installation of new, energy-efficient machinery. We believe that we will be able carry out all planned emission reduction measures to achieve our target using technology that already exists on the market.  However,  additional  cuts  in  GHG  emissions  will  require development of new technology to manage emissions from our process gases1.

1  Process gases are gases used in technical production. These could include inert gases used in welding, soldering and cutting processes.

Phasing out of fossil CO2 emissions

In our own operations, we are constantly working on strategies that will enable us to become fossil-free. Currently, we have a good idea of	our	own	direct	and	indirect	carbon	dioxide	emissions	(Scope	1 and	 2).	 In	 2024,	 we	 continued	 our	 steadfast	 work	 on	 converting our factories and operations to become fossil-free. The next step is to continue to improve the collection of data, particularly under Scope 3, and to continue working on creating activities that will also reduce these indirect emissions.

BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances

This report uses two different definitions of short-, medium- and long-term. The double materiality assessment uses the time horizons defined in ESRS 11 but the climate scenario analysis uses the definitions 1-5 years, 5-10 years and 10-30 years.

The calculation of NIBE Group's indirect (Scope 3) greenhouse gas  (GHG)  emissions  has  required  the  Group  to  estimate  emission volumes linked to certain items or to calculate these using measurements involving significant uncertainty. The reason for this is the lack of high-quality data. This applies to the total Scope 3  emissions  and  all  reported  categories,  primarily  category  3.1 Purchased goods and services and 3.11 Use of sold products.

- Category  3.1  emissions  have  primarily  been  calculated  by multiplying  the  volume  of  materials  and  components  by general factors for this type of material.
- Category 3.11  emissions  have  been  estimated  using  general assumptions about the kind of energy used by our customers when using our products.  The calculations assume that the electricity  purchased  by  our  customers  is  in  line  with  the general electricity mix for each country. If our customers were to purchase fossil-free electricity, the emissions in this category would be significantly lower.

In 2025 we will continue to work towards reducing the use of estimates and reducing measurement uncertainty by improving the quality of the information used for these Scope 3 categories.

With effect from 2025, NIBE Group will be subject to the new EU  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive  (CSRD)  and we therefore need to change the way we work out and present sustainability information in order to meet the requirements of the  European  Sustainability  Reporting  Standards  (ESRS).  The following  bullet  points  show  the  main  changes  compared  with previous reporting periods:

- Our 2024 sustainability report marks a change in our reporting. For the first time, we have carried out a double materiality assessment and included all material sustainability disclosures from the CSRD and the associated ESRS.
- Reporting is based on the outcome of our double materiality assessment.
- Reporting is in line with ESRS topics identified as material matters.
- Our entire value chain, including upstream and downstream activities, is included in reporting.
- The sustainability information is included in the administration report.

It  is  NIBE's  intention  to  report  in  accordance  with  the sustainability reporting requirements of CSRD and ESRS in this report.  However,  2024  is  our  first  year  of  reporting  in  accordance with the new legislation, which means reporting is not yet  complete  and  not  all  requirements  are  met.  This  report meets the requirements for reporting of sustainability data in accordance with  the  GHG  protocol  and  TCFD  and  also  meets the  requirements  of  the  Swedish  Annual  Accounts  Act  for preparing sustainability reports.

CLIMATE GOALS FOR TRANSITION AND CONCRETE ACTIONS

Our products enable us to contribute in a natural way to international ambitions to mitigate climate change. Top priorities in our sustainability  strategy  are  to  develop  innovative  and  competitive  solutions  with  higher  energy  efficiency  and  to  reduce  GHG emissions.

In our own operations, we are continuously working on strategic  initiatives  aimed  at  becoming  fossil-free.  Currently,  we have a good understanding of our own direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions. In 2024, we continued to make changes to our facilities and operations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and we have reported our Scope 1 and 2 direct and indirect emissions for  many  years.  During  the  year,  we  also  continued  to  map  our indirect emissions in the value chain (Scope 3).

Our climate goals, which are described in more detail in E1-4, include reducing GHG emissions in Scope 1 and 2 by 65% by 2030, compared with the base year 2019. This goal is aligned with the Science  Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi)  and,  therefore,  contributes  to  limiting  global  warming  to  1.5°C  in  line  with  the  Paris Agreement. We have not yet set targets for our indirect Scope 3 emissions, which is also required in order for our overall goal to be validated by SBTi. We intend to continue our work relating to our targets and to have them validated by SBTi in the next few years.

Our product development is important if we are to be able to achieve net-zero emissions in our entire value chain in the long term. Our product development enables us to use a larger proportion  of  input  materials  with  a  low  carbon  footprint  and  achieve higher energy efficiency in our products.  For products running on electricity, it is also critical to increase availability of fossil-free energy to be able to achieve net zero. Overall, our transition plan consists of improving energy and material efficiency, switching to renewable fuels, using renewable electricity and phasing out and replacing products and processes.

POTENTIAL LOCKED-IN GHG EMISSIONS

We  can  see  a  risk  of  potential  locked-in  GHG  emissions  from our  assets  and  our  products.  These  locked-in  emissions  could jeopardize our ability to achieve our climate goals and drive the transition risk.

Locked-in emissions from our assets include the vehicle fleet, machinery and other product engineering equipment and heating of  properties.  There  are  electric  or  renewable  alternatives,  but investments in these alternatives are not always justified financially. In addition to our activities to continuously reduce energy consumption, we are actively working on eliminating fossil fuel in heating of production facilities where we own the buildings. In operations where we lease the buildings, we are engaged in dialog with  the  property  owners  regarding  installation  of  fossil-free alternatives.

The majority of our products are powered by electricity, which involves electricity consumption by our customers. However, we do  not  consider  this  to  comprise  locked-in  emissions  because the customer is able to make an active choice to use electricity with lower carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, we predict that most the world's electricity grids will move to a higher proportion of renewable electricity in the coming years. A small proportion of  our  products comprise products that can run on fossil fuels, e.g.  gas-fired  stoves.  In  these  cases  we  foresee  a  larger  challenge concerning locked-in emissions, which will partly limit our opportunities to  reduce  our  Scope  3  emissions  in  the  short-  to medium-term.

The  investments  in  assets  that  contribute  to  the  transition and the reduction of GHG emissions are reported in the Taxonomy report on page 94. During the reporting period no capital expenditures  were  made  in  investments  in  coal-,  oil-  or  gas-related economic activities.

G1-5 Political influence and lobbying activities

We want to support the local communities in which we operate and therefore prioritize contributions and sponsorship agreements that benefit  these.  We  prioritize  agreements  that  support  our  values and strengthen our relationships with customers and partners. We do not contribute to or become involved with political parties, politicians or political organizations, either financially or otherwise, see Table 2. None of the members of the Board or management team of NIBE Group holds, or has held, a similar position with an authority or supervisory authority in the last two years.

On the contrary, NIBE takes an active approach to being a positive force in the transition to a more energy-efficient and fossil-free society.  This  work  primarily  takes  the  form  of  memberships  of various trade associations both nationally and internationally, but also via direct contact with the EU Commission. Management is ultimately  responsible  and  debriefing  takes  place  on  an  ongoing basis.

Through trade associations such as EHPA (European Heat Pump Association), GeoExchange Coalition and Eurovent, NIBE is involved in  developing  new  legislation  and  standards  that  impact  our product  portfolios,  supports  the  association  in  communications with the relevant authorities and receives important information.

Where we have direct contact with policy makers, such as the European Commission, this is aimed at driving the transition on a scientific  basis.  For  example,  NIBE's  efforts  to  ensure  fossil  gas boilers are subject to stricter requirements under Ecodesign are linked to its energy labeling. In another example, we have worked with a university and a national industry organization to produce a study showing how much free cooling a ground source heat pump can provide. The aim of the study has been to make this information visible in the energy labeling of these products. Neither NIBE Industrier or any of our subsidiaries are themselves included in the EU  Transparency  Register  or  similar  transparency  registers  in  a Member State.

An  important  part  of  our  work  on  impacts  is  participation  in national as well as international research projects. These projects are  usually  led  by  seats  of  learning  or  research  institutions  and we can contribute as a reference group, technical experts or by providing products or components.

two highest energy efficiency classes or use a refrigerant with a  GWP  value  of  less  than  675,  and  meet  the  energy  efficiency requirements  of  the  Ecodesign  regulation.  Against  this  background, we carried out mapping to establish which heat pumps are taxonomy-eligible and performed measurements to compare their performance with the limit values set out in the regulations referred to in the taxonomy.

Similar  work  is  underway  and  will  continue  in  the  coming year in respect of DNSH criteria. The aim is to be able to establish whether or not operations located outside the EU meet these criteria.

STRATEGY

E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation

464,669
tonnes of carbon dioxide
We are reducing customers' emissions

A reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases is essential if the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and the Group's sustainability strategies are to be met. One of the most important things we can do to realize this ambition is to reduce our customers' emissions.

Reduction of 464,669 metric tons of carbon dioxide Based on the cuts in emissions from the type of heating systems our heat pumps replaced in the respective markets in 2023 alone, the reduction was 463,963 metric tons of CO2 in that year.

Reduce our CO2 emissions

6  5%

Our long-term goal is to be carbon neutral by 2050. The target is to reduce our direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 65% by	2030	compared	with	the	2019 baseline.

THE WAY FORWARD IS ENERGY OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL

The use of private cars and heavy goods vehicles on roads both present a major challenge when it comes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Several countries are therefore currently implementing major projects to renew and improve infrastructure, particularly that of railbased transport.

E1-7 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits
E1-8 Internal carbon pricing

We are on a journey in our climate-related work. Many activities remain  that  will  require  our  attention  going  forward.  Our  focus up to now has been to understand and reduce our own and our customers' emissions, but there are opportunities for us to also

ENERGY EFFICIENCY REQUIRED FOR A MORE RESOURCE-EFFICIENT SOCIETY

The  international  ambition  to  reduce  the  increase  in  the  global average  temperature  to  less  than  two  degrees  Celsius  requires  a reduction	in	GHG	emissions	equating	to	70%	by	2050	(compared	with the	base	year	2010).	This	is	equivalent	to	an	annual	reduction	of	6.5% in GHG emissions. NIBE Group's products contribute to the transition to a fossil-free society through reduced energy consumption. We are ambitious and persistent in our work on developing a product portfolio	of	energy-efficient	energy	solutions	that	support	this	transition.

UNCERTAINTY FACTORS

Our  assessment  is  that  there  are  no  major  uncertainties  in  the resilience  analysis,  other  than  in  respect  of  decisions  by  the authorities and legal requirements. There is also some uncertainty about the kind of new technology that may need to be developed to  manage  climate  risks,  whether  locally  or  internationally.  The political  situation may also be an uncertainty factor, depending on the location of our operations.

We have a clear picture of investment requirements up until 2030 for our own operations, including buildings, transport and reinforcement  measures  for  extreme  weather  events.  In  the case of subsidiaries that are more exposed, we take their assets and  business  activities  into  consideration  by  collating  investment decisions, planning activities and preparing action plans to reduce risk. These investment plans are linked to our short- and medium-term risks and focus on the useful lives of assets and the  distribution  of  capital.  We  have  established  an  investment framework to implement these actions. Managing these risks is an important part of NIBE's strategy and we evaluate and identify new risks on an ongoing basis.

We  have  a  good  understanding  of  our  own  climate  impact in  Scopes 1 and 2, but there is still some uncertainty related to our indirect emissions in Scope 3. We are working on improving the reliability of this data, which will enable us to gain increased understanding of the kind of activities that increase or reduce our climate impact. Total GHG emissions are reported for our different Scopes in ESRS E1-6.

E2-3 Targets related to pollution

We have not currently defined any targets for substances of  concern  or  substances  of  very  high  concern.  However, it  is  our  aim to develop relevant and measurable targets in line with the substitution principle to comply with the Do No Significant  Harm  (DNSH)  criteria  for  substances  in  the  EU Taxonomy. The Group-wide system will play a key role in this work to be able to continue collecting data and developing the work in line with the existing policy document.

NIBE GROUP'S IMPACT

One of the biggest challenges involved in achieving  a  global  sustainable  society  is  to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and slow down the current rate of climate change. There is clear scientific evidence that climate change is causing natural disasters and extreme weather conditions,  reducing  biodiversity,  threatening our  living  standards  and  undermining  political stability in society.

(Scope  3),  primarily  through  use  of  energy  for the  products  we  sell,  but  also  from  purchased transport and purchased products and services.

However,  our  products  help  most  of  our customers to avoid GHG emissions. This is due to  the  fact  that  we  place  LCE  (Low  Carbon Economy)  classified  products  on  the  market, such  as  heat  pumps  that  reduce  customers'

Since  2011,  we  have  worked  systematically  to reduce  our  climate  impact  in  many  different ways. We can achieve the largest reductions in GHG emissions in our direct and energy-related emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by switching to renewable  energy  in  our  own  buildings,  by  making changes to production processes and by using electricity or renewable fuels for transport. Our largest  impact  comes  from  indirect  emissions

Outcome

The outcome of the risk assessment is integrated into the Group's overall work with risk management and assessed for priority in the same way as other risks.  None of the identified opportunities or risks necessitated a change to our overall management process.

IRO-1, E1 Processes to identify climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities

SBM-3, E1 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

We  have  identified  several  climate-related  risks,  both  physical risks and transition risks. The assessment of physical climate-related risks is based on the physical addresses of our operations, with  geographical  coordinates  or  addresses  used  for  a  more precise risk assessment.

Acute risks are defined locally, chronic risks are assessed on a national or regional level and transition risks are global. The initial resilience analysis was conducted in 2022 and covered all Group companies,  but  did  not  include  the  upstream  and  downstream value chain.

Responsibility in business and related risks

Our  business  principles  and  values 1 are  based  on  the conviction that  great freedom  coupled with  responsibility creates	good	profitability	and	longevity.	Business	conduct and corporate social responsibility are fundamental to our ability to live up to our management philosophy and create the necessary conditions for a stable corporation.

Risk assessment and evaluation of both new and existing suppliers and their performance is carried out on a continuous basis. This provides support and security around our choice of supplier and ensures continued strong cooperation. If we identify unacceptable risks or a lack of desire to make improvements, we will terminate the collaboration.

TARGETS
S2-5 Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities

In  2024, we have included more steps in our value chain than the suppliers of direct materials that we focused on previously. This means we will need to assess risks within the new supplier areas in 2025.

One remaining objective is that all new suppliers of direct materials should be evaluated in our third party system. EcoVadis is now able to produce more specific data, which is also more representative of the industries in which our suppliers operate. This means that in 2025 we will need to evaluate which additional targets or metrics, if any, we should use for our material areas.

Minimum safeguards

We have updated processes and systems on site in order to identify and reduce risks relating to human rights, anti-corruption and labor rights. Work on implementing these processes and systems for our suppliers, customers and partners is ongoing and is being conducted in accordance with the guidelines and principles set out in the UN Global Compact and the OECD.

G1-2 Management of relationships with suppliers

NIBE's work on responsible sourcing is designed to ensure that our ethical guidelines are followed by suppliers and sub-suppliers. The work forms part  of  the  supplier  evaluation  and  comprises

areas  such  as  health  and  safety,  the  environment,  human rights,  product  legislation  and  ethical  guidelines.  For  more information on our risk assessment and policies for this area, see S2 Workers in the value chain.

According to our guidelines, we should always strive to apply good business ethics, which means we should be honest, treat our business partners with respect and comply with the agreements we have entered into in respect of e.g. terms of payment.

International guidelines and initiatives

We  follow  and  work  according  to  several  internationally

recognized standards, guidelines and principles. Our guidelines  and  policies  are  based  on  international  conventions and  initiatives  such  as  the  Global  Compact,  ISO  26000 (international guidelines for matters	 relating to social responsibility)	 and	 the	 Swedish	 Anti-Corruption	 Institute and	its	business	code	(IMM).

We submit an annual report on our progress to the UN Global Compact in accordance with the principles we have signed and committed to work with in our value chain. Our report is published on the Group's website.

ENERGY-EFFICIENT INFRASTRUC TURE AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY

Demand  for  technology  that  supports  the  climate  transition  will increase and, as this technology becomes more available, the market will grow.

Population  growth  and  urbanization  boost  demand  for  the transportation  of  both  products  and  people.  The  transport  sector is  regarded  as  one  of  the  greatest  challenges  as  it  is  responsible for	 a	 significant	 proportion	 of	 societal	 GHG	 emissions	 and	 energy consumption.

A great deal of research and development is being carried out in both energy optimization and renewable energy. We believe that we stand at the forefront in our industry sectors.

SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT

Paying attention to detail is an important parameter to be able to comply with regulatory requirements for our products.

METRICS AND TARGETS
G1-4 Incidents of corruption or bribery

We did not have any confirmed cases of corruption and bribery in the reporting year and consequently no convictions.

International guidelines and initiatives

We follow and work according to several internationally recognized standards, guidelines and principles. Our guidelines and policies are based on international conventions and initiatives such as the UN Global	 Compact,	 ISO	 26000	 (international	 guidelines	 for	 handling social	responsibility	issues)	and	the	Swedish	Anti-Corruption	Institute and its Code for business. We submit an annual report on our progress to the UN Global Compact in accordance with the principles we have signed and committed to work with in our value chain.

NIBE GROUP'S IMPACT
G1-1 Business conduct policies and corporate culture
POLICY FOR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

A  healthy  corporate  culture  characterized  by transparency,  integrity  and  accountability  is crucial in order to prevent, detect and react to failure to comply with both laws and our values and  policies.  In  an  international  group  it  is  of utmost  importance  to  actively  counteract  the risk  of  corruption  or  other  irregularities.  NIBE is  therefore  continuously  working  to  promote responsible business conduct among our employees, in respect of customers and suppliers,  and  in  the  communities  in  which  we operate. Our values underpin this work.

NIBE  is  an  international  company  with  many employees  and  we  therefore  set  great  store by  our  work  on  anti-corruption  and  prohibited restraint  of  trade.  Our  values  and  business principles  entail  zero  tolerance  of  all  forms  of corruption and apply to all parts of our business, including  our  business  partners.  We  have  two policies related to business conduct and corporate culture, in addition to our values.

Climate scenario 3 (RCP 4.5)

RCP 4.5 is a climate scenario in which GHG emissions have fallen due to current and planned actions, resulting in global warming stabilizing at around 2.5-3°C by the end of the century. Society is impacted by an increase in extreme weather events, rising sea levels  and  ecosystem  change,  leading  to  infrastructure,  food supply and public health challenges.

EMISSION REDUCTIONS LINKED TO OUR ACTIONS

Achieved and expected GHG emission reductions due to actions taken  are  presented  under  targets  and  outcomes  below.  We assess that we will be able to achieve the adopted targets. There is  a  strong  relationship  between  our  opportunities  for  reducing our GHG emissions and the access to resources such as funding. In years when the financial situation has been strained, we have carried out fewer investments. However, long term we often see that operating costs decrease after we have invested in new, more efficient machinery.

Our Taxonomy report includes the monetary amounts of our capital expenditure.  Some of the described taxonomy activities correspond to actions we have taken as part of our transition plan. The expenditure reported in the Taxonomy report is included in Note 15 in the financial statements.

Distribution

Disruption in the distribution chain can have a negative impact on customers, and higher freight volumes  mean  higher  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  The  distribution  channels  are  checked  regularly. Procedures are in place for following up and taking any required action. In addition, transportation is coordinated and used efficiently to reduce emissions and make it greener.

GHG INTENSITY BASED ON NET REVENUE

start  to  identify  GHG  emissions  in  our  value  chain,  purchase carbon credits or apply internal carbon pricing.

A  reconciliation  to  the  financial  statements,  Note  4,  is  shown below.  Companies  acquired  during  the  year  have  not  started climate-related reporting but have reported financial key ratios. Therefore, the disclosed GHG intensity includes only companies that reported their GHG emissions for the financial year.

2024

In the financial year, we began the process of aligning our reporting to meet the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). As a result of this extensive and comprehensive reporting, we have decided to cease reporting according to GRI and to not include SDG in the annual report.

Just as in previous years, the sustainability trend is continuing to place more demands on our products and our activities. For us  as  a  company,  reporting  has  become  more  comprehensive in connection with various directives within the EU Green Deal. This  includes  directives,  regulations  and  laws  such  as  the  EU Taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD),	the	future	updated	Ecodesign	Directive	and	the	Corporate	Sustainability	Due	Diligence	Directive	(CSDDD).

At NIBE, we are continuing to sharpen our skills in respect of  environment and climate, social responsibility and ethical issues. Not only because the requirements concerning these areas  are  becoming  increasingly  rigorous,  but  because  we want to have the right tools and conditions to steer the industry towards	 taking	 greater	 responsibility	 and	 to	 fulfil	 our	 own commitments.  Environment  and  climate  and  social  aspects are also an integral part of due diligence in acquisitions.

We  are  continuing  to  develop  a  systematic  approach  to life cycle assessments (LCA) and environmental product declarations	 (EPD),	 and	 we	 also	 expect	 significantly	 stricter requirements in certain areas in future in respect of substances in products and components.

Our	own	five	sustainability	targets	continue	to	serve	as	key guidelines  for  how  to  run  our  business.  We  are  continuing  to focus on these, with particular emphasis on our carbon dioxide and energy goals, where we have set targets for 2030 to reduce energy  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  our operations.
