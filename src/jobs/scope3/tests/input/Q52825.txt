The scope of consolidation for GHG emissions reporting follows the Group standards outlined in the section “Approach to reporting” at the beginning of this Sustainability Statement.
In 2024 mergers and acquisitions did not constitute significant changes to the GHG emissions reporting.


<!-- PAGE: 36 -->
We calculate our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using detailed methodologies that incorporate assumptions and standardized emissions factors.
For scope 1 emissions from our fleet vehicles we collect vehicle specific data such as fuel type distance traveled and emissions profiles for every vehicle in the fleet.
If this is not available estimations are applied.
In particular the distance travelled is estimated based on the leasing contract duration.
Fleet emissions factors are based on WLTP/NEDC emission profiles per vehicle and provided in g CO2/km.
They are then adjusted to the lab to road factor based on the vehicle's location.

Emissions from the on site use of fuel coolants and SF6 are calculated using data reported quarterly or annually depending on the facility size with site specific emissions factors.
For scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity and district heating we collect and process energy consumption data from facilities worldwide applying both location based and market based emissions factors.
Location based calculations use average grid emission factors in kg CO2e/kWh specific to each geographic location while market based calculations consider specific contractual arrangements like renewable energy purchases or power purchase agreements with emissions factors obtained from external industry sources.
For a minority of locations where environmental data is not readily available we employ an estimation process.
This includes in particular smaller sites with energy consumption lower than 100 MWh per year and fewer than 100 employees.
For these sites environmental data is extrapolated based on the employee headcount at these sites and average consumption per employee from sample reporting sites.
For Q4 estimations were applied where year end actuals have not been available at the time of reporting.

In scope 1 we only consider methane and N2O emissions of biogenic emissions following SBTi guidance amounting to 2 t of CO2e in 2024.
Biogenic emissions of 2,370 t of CO2e are not included in scope 1.

Our renewable electricity consumption comes from bundled and unbundled procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) as well as onsite solar PV generation.

For scope 3 emissions we account for all scope 3 categories that are relevant to ABB and that are not covered in scope 1 and 2 (refer to the list of included categories above).
As the vast majority of our emissions stem from the use of sold products this category represents the most significant contribution.
Nevertheless we diligently calculate all other scope 3 categories relevant to ABB to ensure comprehensive reporting.
When assessing the materiality of the different scope 3 categories we refer to the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard.
The calculation of scope 3 category 11 emissions is based on a bottom up model for the diverse offering across our divisions.
The model considers both the technical specifications and the operating conditions associated with each product including product energy consumption metrics and efficiency specifications.
We use two primary methods to estimate energy consumption during the operational phase of sold products

- • Energy Input Method: Applied to products that require specific power inputs to perform their tasks, such as motors, automation systems and robotics.

- • Energy Loss Method: Used for products where energy efficiency losses are critical, such as electrical drives and switchgear.

The total energy consumed is converted to GHG emissions using regional emission factors from the IEA in alignment with regional electricity grid compositions.
These factors are updated annually to reflect changes in grid emission intensities.


<!-- PAGE: 37 -->
Remaining scope 3 emissions (everything apart from category 11) encompass a broad range of indirect emissions.
Data sources include for example spend figures for purchased products and services transportation and distribution or business travel.
Depending on the category we use different methods to calculate these emissions

- • Spend-Based Method: Applied to categories such as purchased goods and services or capital goods, where we calculated emissions based on the financial expenditure. Emission factors are derived from economic inputoutput models that relate spending to GHG emissions (e.g., Exiobase).

- • Activity-Based Method: For categories such as business travel, emissions are approximated using activity data such as travel miles, number of trips and transportation modes.

The total emissions are then converted to GHG emissions using regional emission factors (where applicable) ensuring alignment with the geographical areas where activities occur.

The scope 3 data collection is supported by an ABB customized reporting tool in line with our internal and external assurance requirements.

For the calculation of avoided emissions ABB has developed a methodology based on WBCSD guidance tailored to its product portfolio.
According to WBCSD's guidance “avoided emissions” refers to the reduction in GHG emissions achieved by comparing our products or solutions to a reference scenario where the solution is not used.
Both the product and reference scenario are assessed through their entire life cycles.
Three scenarios are considered replacement retrofit and new installation.
Data is collected covering the percentage of sales or orders where deemed more relevant and kWh/t CO₂e.
The data is drawn from our sales teams and the products’ technical specifications.
Alongside the three scenarios several factors provided by the WBCSD guidance for avoided emissions affect the eligibility of avoided emissions against our ambition

- • Gate 1 (climate action credibility): ABB transparently reports on 100 percent of its value chain emissions on an annual basis. This covers 13 of the 15 scope 3 GHG Protocol categories. Using this comprehensive GHG inventory, we have set SBTi targets. We will not be using avoided emissions to claim net-zero status.

- • Gate 2 (climate science alignment): We do not consider avoided emissions from product lines or solutions sold to sectors and applications linked to exploration, extraction, mining, production, distribution or sale of fossil fuels.

- • Gate 3 (contribution legitimacy): We only consider avoided emissions that arise from installations that drive change within their respective markets. For example, only high-efficiency motors in a higher energy-efficiency class than the installed base average and used in a retrofit application would be eligible for inclusion. As for general applications like drives, we consider the retrofit of existing direct-on-line motor-driven systems as their main contribution to avoided emissions. In new installations of motor-driven systems, we exclude applications where the customer has already decided to install a drive. We only include sales where the customer has been convinced to install a drive with the motor, thereby improving overall efficiency.


<!-- PAGE: 38 -->
Avoided emissions are calculated based on the following formula

# Avoided lifetime emissions (kg CO₂e) = annual energy saved (MWh) × emission factor (kg CO₂e/MWh) × lifetime (years)

- • Annual energy saved: Energy saved on a yearly basis when comparing the product or solution with the relevant reference scenario using the following four elements: a) power input of the product/solution assuming use of 100 percent of rated energy input value1, b) operating hours per year,

1 Due to the lack of readily available precise external data or analysis we utilize the best available assumptions.
The avoided

|  | c) percentage of revenues from eligible avoided emissions scenarios (replacements retrofits new installations)1 d) percentage of efficiency gains in each scenario. |
| --- | --- |
| emission calculation is highly sensitive to these assumptions. A percentage change in either assumption will result in an equivalent percentage change in the calculated avoided lifetime emissions. | •Emission factor Weighted average emission factor based on geography of where the respective product or solution is used using the IEA and United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) data multiplied by regional revenue exposure. •Lifetime Average expected lifetime of the product or solution using Product Category Rules data when available and applicable used also for the product's or solution's Life Cycle Assessment or expert opinion if not available. Reporting periods of value chain and ABB entities do not differ significantly and limited effects on our GHG emission reporting are expected. Currently we primarily use secondary data to calculate scope 3 emissions. Certain scope 3 GHG emission categories are not applicable to ABB such as category 8 (upstream leased assets) has been excluded as we already account for our leased assets within our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emission footprint through the operational control consolidation approach. By including leased assets in scope 1 and 2 further inclusion in scope 3 would lead to double counting and is therefore not applicable. Category 14 (franchises) has been excluded because we do not operate any franchises. The scope 3 categories included in our inventory are shown in the table “Overview of scope 1 2 and 3 GHG emissions”. We report scope 3 GHG emissions following the boundaries and methodologies defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The reporting scope covers both upstream and downstream activities including categories as defined in ESRS E1-6 AR 46.i ensuring comprehensive representation of our value chain. Emissions are attributed based on our operational and value chain control excluding immaterial sources or categories not applicable to our business model such as franchises.
| —Physical and transition climate risks and opportunities | E1-9 ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL EFFECTS PHYSICAL RISKS The qualitative physical risk assessment clustered approximately 340 sites in low to high risk categories. The findings of the assessment showed an increased risk of floods and storms across the short medium and long term time horizons under
![table image]({page: 38, x: 231}, {y: 167, {width: 475}, {height: 79})

different scenarios.
Our analysis indicates that the hazards identified are expected to have a medium impact under the moderate RCP4.5 scenario.
However the severity of these hazards and the impact on our business may increase under the more extreme RCP8.5 scenario which confirms the understanding that higher rates of global warming increase the susceptibility to those climate related risks.

A limited number of sites in the United States and China show high counts of identified climate related physical risks applicable for both acute and chronic risk in the long term within ABB\'s asset portfolio.
The assets could be temporarily impacted through reduced production capacities as well as face higher insurance premiums in the future.


<!-- PAGE: 39 -->
When examining hazards such as flooding under a strong global warming RCP8.5 scenario we observe a progressive increase in the number of assets at higher risk levels between the medium and long term time horizon.
Similarly for storms under the RCP8.5 scenario there is a rise in the number of assets at high risk indicating a growing risk level over time.

<!-- PAGE: 33 -->
The consistency between our GHG emissions reduction targets and the GHG inventory boundaries is ensured through clearly defined and documented inventory boundaries that are reviewed annually.
Material changes in our structure acquisitions or divestments are reflected accordingly.
Within our alignment to SBTi we have committed to incorporate all significant emission sources in our inventory and to annually report on all relevant scope 3 categories.

For scope 1 and 2 the baseline year remains 2019.
Reorganizations divestments and acquisitions have been reflected in restatements of the 2019 value in the years since 2020.
For scope 3 the baseline year was set to 2022 as the target was introduced during 2023 and the previous year best represented the current business structure.
The same applies to the baseline for the ambition to avoid emissions.

—Management of climate change E1-3 ACTIONS Our efforts and achievements in addressing climate change are three fold

- • We are committed to reducing emissions in our own operations

- • We are committed to reducing emissions in our value chain by supporting our suppliers to reduce their emissions, and

- • We are committed to helping our customers reduce and avoid emissions through our products, solutions and services.

To reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions several decarbonization levers have been defined and are being implemented.
These levers can be disaggregated into fossil fuel reduction (through energy efficiency and decarbonization of fossil fueled assets) a shift to renewable energy fleet electrification and SF6 management.
The commitments to the RE100 EV100 and EP100 initiatives will support the reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030.

For scope 3 the levers to reduce the most material categories specifically emissions from use of sold products and purchased goods and services are disclosed in the transition plan section of this statement.

## PROTECTING THE CLIMATE

|  |
| --- |
| —Toward a low carbon economy | Enabling a low carbon society is at the center of our purpose and value proposition and a key pillar of our Sustainability Agenda. At ABB we want to help our customers reduce and avoid emissions through our products solutions and services. We also work toward reducing emissions in our own operations and in those of our suppliers. We aim to drive the shift towards a low carbon economy with innovative technologies. Our expertise in electrification and automation enables greater energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energies into the energy mix. We work with our customers and suppliers to help them save energy and reduce emissions across their value chains. Our commitment to supporting energy security and the transition to a low carbon society is also demonstrated by the work we are doing to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in our own operations.
| E1-1 TRANSITION PLAN IN PROGRESS |
| The basis for our climate transition plan is our set of near and long term greenhouse gas reduction targets (scope 1 2 and 3) which were approved by the Executive Committee (EC) and the Board of Directors in 2023. These targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in June 2024 as being in line with the net zero standard. Our long term targets are also aligned with the Swiss climate goals. In 2024 our scope 1 and 2 targets were part of our annual incentive plan (AIP) and included in the long term incentive plan (LTIP) for the top management (for AIP and LTIP see p. 9). The 2024 forecast of scope 3 category 1 emissions were set at division level and approved by the EC. The full scope 3 division level forecast for 2030 will be approved by the EC in 2025. We report annually on our greenhouse gas reduction performance against scopes 1 2 and 3. In line with our SBTi net zero absolute reduction targets we are committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050. As the SBTi net zero standard only allows for Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) to be used for a maximum of 10 percent of residual emissions in 2050 rather than for the 2030 targets we will analyze the respective investment options later. To reduce ABB's operational emissions (scopes 1 and 2) we have defined and are implementing several decarbonization levers. When it comes to our value chain our products and solutions help our customers reduce emissions. At the same time our scope 3 category 11 emissions increase as long as the electricity in the grid is not decarbonized. To tackle value chain emissions where scope 3 category 1 and scope 3 category 11 represent 3.1 percent and 96.6 percent of emissions respectively we have identified the following decarbonization levers |
| Scope 3.1 |
|  | (3.1 % of total scope 3) 1. Collaborate with suppliers and customers on low carbon material availability and use 2. Increase availability of product carbon footprints (PCFs) from suppliers

TURNOVER KPI

The proportion of Taxonomy eligible and/or -aligned turnover has been calculated as the part of net turnover derived from products and services associated with Taxonomy eligible and/or -aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by net turnover (denominator) for the financial year ended December 31 2024.

The denominator is the Group's net turnover as presented in the Consolidated Income Statements under the line item “Total revenues” in accordance with US GAAP.
To calculate the numerator we used the activity mapping described above and identified all third party revenues associated with the Taxonomy eligible and/or -aligned activities.

For the year ended December 31 2024 44 percent of our revenues are eligible under the objective of Climate Change Mitigation (CCM).
Additionally 10 percent of our revenues are eligible under the objective of Transition to Circular Economy (CE).
The aligned revenue reported under both CCM and CE activities is negligible resulting in the alignment figure being rounded to 0 percent.
The contribution of our business activities was calculated and reported under one economic activity without double counting.


<!-- PAGE: 53 -->
In comparison in 2023 46 percent of our revenues were Taxonomy eligible and 6 percent of our revenues were Taxonomy aligned.

Against this background most of our Taxonomy eligible turnover is reported under

- • CCM 3.20 Manufacture, installation, and servicing of high, medium, and low voltage electrical equipment for electrical transmission and distribution,

- • CE 1.2 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment, and

- • CCM 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies.

The expansion of the EU Taxonomy scope had already been reflected in last year's eligibility results.
Consequently the slight year on year variations in eligibility are attributed to further refinements in our eligibility mapping process.
While the EU Taxonomy now has more activities relevant to our business model compared to prior years a significant portion of our business activities continues to fall outside the scope of the EU Taxonomy.
The notable decrease in EU Taxonomy aligned turnover from 2023 to 2024 is attributed to the currently unmet pollution related criteria (Appendix C).

The details of the turnover KPI and breakdowns are provided on page 91 of the Sustainability Statement.

<!-- PAGE: 32 -->
We have also committed to three initiatives of the Climate Group to help us to achieve our near term scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target

- • Consume 100 percent of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Commitment made to RE100 initiative.

- • Electrify our global vehicle fleet by 2030. Commitment made to EV100 initiative.

- • Improve our energy productivity by 20 percent by 2030 relative to 2019 and implement an energy management system across global operations by 2030. Commitment made to EP100 initiative.

## — Scope 2 GHG emissions

Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (electricity steam heat cooling) from an utility provider.

## E1: CLIMATE CHANGE

ABB's value chain from raw material extraction to end of life impacts climate change.
Manufacturing assembly and logistics from our own operations contribute directly to greenhouse gas emissions.
We mitigate this through energy efficient processes use of renewable energy sustainable upstream practices and supplier engagement.
At the same time our technologies enhance customers’ energy efficiency leading to emissions reductions.

Climate change also poses risks to our infrastructure operations and employee safety but acting on climate change provides opportunities.
Collaboration with governments and NGOs aids the transition to a low carbon economy while innovations in renewable energy and efficiency secure our market leadership reputation and talent attraction alongside reducing carbon footprint and costs through diverse energy sourcing.

## SBM-3: MATERIAL IROs AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH STRATEGY AND BUSINESS
### MODEL

The type of workers in our entire upstream and downstream value chain is diverse.
It can include workers in raw materials and minerals extraction and processing employees in factories contractors at sites and workers in logistics and distribution.
These different groups of workers might also include workers from vulnerable groups such as migrant workers young people or women.

ABB is committed to support and respect human rights and labor standards and to comply with internationally recognized standards laws and regulations including the elimination of modern slavery and child labor as well as the right to work under fair and safe conditions.
It encompasses access to fair wages the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and respecting the rights of communities and individuals when providing security for people and assets.
We also recognize our responsibility to promote an organizational culture that supports human rights and to respect and promote human and labor rights along our value chain.
This includes assessing and monitoring any human rights risks that customers suppliers business partners and other parties directly linked to ABB operations products and services might present.

In our value chain there is a potential risk of negative impacts on individuals including the risk of modern slavery and child labor.
In addition health and safety risks can occur in mining when workers face unsafe conditions.
Chemicals and heavy machinery usage in upstream processes can also pose health risks to workers.

To make ABB's IROs better understood we performed a DMA in 2024.
The DMA identified 16 IROs of which 15 were impacts and one an opportunity.
No material risk was identified.
Eight IROs were identified in the upstream value chain three in the downstream and five in both.
The opportunity is also in the upstream value chain and refers to the improvement of human rights due diligence through the use of software tools that help to improve compliance by verifying a company's performance in this area before becoming an ABB supplier.


<!-- PAGE: 70 -->
Of the 15 impacts 10 were regarded as actually positive two as actually negative and three as potentially negative.
The actually positive impacts include programs to counteract workers losing jobs due to automation ABB's position against violence and harassment across the value chain fostering a physically and mentally safe environment with positive working conditions.
Our Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) Program audits and assessments our active membership of the Responsible Minerals Initiative alongside our complaint system for value chain workers and associated policies and trainings demonstrate our commitment to the safety and wellbeing of all individuals in our value chain and foster the positive impact on value chain workers.

Negative impacts identified include the fact that physical work in raw material extraction (such as mining) can expose workers to unhealthy and dangerous working conditions.
The same upstream processes can expose workers to instances of modern slavery human trafficking or child labor.

—Supplier related policies S2-1 POLICIES ABB uses several policies and procedures to manage its impact on workers in the value chain.
Some of them are overarching documents that apply to more than one topical chapter of this Sustainability Statement.
These can be found at the end of the chapter “Sustainability at ABB” and include the ABB Way the ABB Supplier Code of Conduct and the Human Rights Policy & Human Rights Due Diligence Framework.
More specific policies are outlined below.

##### Scope 3.11 (96.6% of total scope 3)

Decarbonizing electricity grids is the single most critical element to reduce ABB's scope 3 category 11 emissions.

- 1. Market ABB products and solutions that enable electricity grid decarbonization

- 2. Innovate to increase the product portfolio that enables energy efficiency and decarbonization

- 3. Collaborate with customers to implement the most efficient ABB technology solutions

In 2024 we completed a physical and transition risk assessment.
We intend to integrate the results of this risk assessment into the climate transition plan.

We will be formalizing our scope 3 decarbonization measures and quantifying the financial effects excluding NET investments and seeking approval of our transition plan.

—Climate risk and opportunity assessment ESRS 2 SBM 3 RESILIENCE IN CLIMATE MATTERS The DMA performed in 2024 (see chapter “Sustainability at ABB” sections “Material impacts risks and opportunities” and “Double Materiality Assessment”) identified 24 IROs relating to climate three of which were classified as risks.

Two of the identified risks are categorized as physical risks.
One of these focuses on direct effects of extreme weather events on our facilities whereas the second of these takes into consideration the health and security of our employees.
The third risk is classified as a policy and legal transition risk which could require adjustments to a specific product category.

During 2024 we also performed a detailed climate risk assessment focusing on physical and transition risks based on defined climate scenarios.
Of the identified physical climate risks storms and floods were assessed as the most relevant acute hazards while heat and precipitation stress were assessed as the most relevant chronic hazards.

For transition risks the qualitative assessment concluded that market policy and legal as well as reputation are the categories which could potentially pose the highest risks for ABB.

For further information on our climate risk assessment please also see the section on IRO 1 below.

Based on the insights gained from this assessment mitigation and adaptation measures can be defined and assessed to address the identified vulnerabilities enabling our business areas and divisions to either implement risk responses or accept the associated risks.


<!-- PAGE: 27 -->
Our susceptibility to physical risks centers around the climate related hazards of storms and floods which was highlighted through the risk assessment based on a high emission scenario.
We invest in adaptation measures to improve our resilience including emergency response planning as well as infrastructure and equipment enhancements.
Further potential measures to improve our resilience were also identified on a hazard specific basis as an outcome of the climate risk assessment.
Measures being considered for potential implementation in the future include for example on site water storages to address water stress at relevant sites.

Market transition risks are addressed through continuous investments in research and development for low carbon technologies which not only mitigates risks but also enables us to benefit from the opportunities in market segments that are identified as growth drivers especially in a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement.

Policy and legal transition risks may have an influence on the pricing or availability of raw materials.
In addition regulatory changes may prohibit the production and sales of specific products which may directly reduce our revenues.
To mitigate such risks we are evaluating alternative measures which are not exposed in the same magnitude to policy interventions such as carbon pricing.
In addition we are closely monitoring the regulatory environment to adapt to new regulations with corresponding research and development efforts.

|  | Reputational transition risks can result from our own ambition and targets that we have committed to. If for example we were not to meet our GHG scope 1 2 or 3 emission reduction targets by 2030 or our SBTi commitment this may reflect poorly on our reputation. |

| —Material impacts risks and opportunities resulting from climate change | IRO 1 PROCESSES TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MATERIAL IROs ABB's climate related IROs have been a decisive element in our 2024 DMA. A number of other processes analyses and assessments contributed to our understanding of the prevalent risks. This includes our analyses of physical and transition risks resulting from climate change as well as our analyses of company emissions data publicly available climate change scenarios and pathways and their application in the context of the ABB Group and their potential implications in the future. The DMA revealed 24 IROs for ABB regarding climate of which ten were classified as impacts three as risks and eleven as opportunities. IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE Of the ten impacts identified in our DMA four were regarded as positive one in our own operations and the others in the upstream or downstream value chain and six as negative three in our own operations and three in the value chain. The negative impacts in our own operations result from (a) the production process for the materials used and the assembly of the products (b) the burning of fossil based fuel sources and (c) the energy consumption from buildings. Negative impacts resulting from our value chain include processes such as raw material extraction transportation the smelting of components and manufacturing processes where energy intensive methods are used that cause high greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions intensify climate change. Positive impacts include the fact that by developing energy efficient processes we can reduce our energy consumption and associated emissions. Implementing sustainable practices in the upstream value chain together with suppliers such as using clean energy energy efficiency measures or recycled materials can help to reduce the overall carbon footprint. Furthermore ABB technologies used by our customers and end users can potentially enhance energy efficiency and reduce resource consumption which leads to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. PHYSICAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE Physical climate risks are associated with the direct impact of climate change on our assets operations and value chain. These risks can be chronic or acute. Chronic physical risks refer to long term changes in climate patterns such as rising temperatures sea level rise or changing precipitation patterns. These gradual changes can lead to increased operational costs reduced productivity and damage to infrastructure. Acute physical risks on the other hand involve immediate extreme weather events like hurricanes floods wildfires or heatwaves. Such events can cause sudden and severe asset damage and disruptions to operations leading to losses in revenue and additional capital expenditures to rebuild assets as well as safety concerns. As part of our climate risk assessment we have a comprehensive approach for identifying and assessing physical risks arising from climate change which can be summarized in the following key steps • Relevant scenarios informed by the latest scientific research and relevant for the situation at ABB are identified and an appropriate time horizon is chosen for the analysis. We use advanced natural hazards and climate modelling tools along with scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change • (IPCC) including the high emissions scenario of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5) to assess climate hazards and their risk impacts on operational sites. •Each scenario is qualitatively assessed at two different time horizons medium term (one to five years) and long term (30 years). Specifically for the physical risk assessment short and medium term time horizons are considered simultaneously as the difference in these brief periods hardly result in relevant changes of the underlying scenario data. The selection of time horizons for physical risks focuses on the current reporting cycle (one year) strategic planning horizons and capital allocation plans (up to five years) as well as expected operational lifetimes of our assets which are assumed to be operational either based on their remaining technical lifetime or continuous long term operation at those sites. The long term horizon also considers the expectation that adverse climate related events could become more frequent and increase in severity. •To conduct the assessment data on our asset structure geolocations and other factors are collected from internal systems. The sites in scope cover the largest sites across all business areas based on their energy consumption and headcount and are located in 59 countries represented by manufacturing and non manufacturing sites distributed across the globe. •Geospatial physical risk data is obtained from specialized tools complemented by an internal methodology and employed to perform a detailed risk assessment for the selected time horizons and scenarios. •A combined risk and vulnerability assessment is completed integrating data to assess potential climate related hazards which considers return periods hazard severity as well as risk scores. We decided to focus the initial physical risk assessment on our own operations because direct effects are expected to have the highest significance. In addition due to our global value chain structure it is expected that many of the physical climate risks identified are generally applicable to the supply chain and to customers. Extending the assessment to the value chain is anticipated for future years. TRANSITION RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE Climate transition risks and opportunities arise from the shift towards a low carbon economy and the broader societal and regulatory response to climate change. The risks encompass a range of factors including regulatory changes market dynamics technological advancements shifts in consumer preferences as well as litigation risks. For example stricter environmental regulations such as carbon pricing or emission reduction targets can increase operational costs or necessitate substantial changes in business practices. Transition risks also include reputational risks where failure to address climate change adequately could damage a company's reputation and stakeholder relationships. Similarly market risks may emerge as demand shifts towards more sustainable products and services potentially affecting our market share and profitability for certain products. At the same time this can lead to opportunities such as increased demand for other products and services which support the transition to a low carbon economy. Further potential opportunities relate to improving resource efficiency transitioning to lower emission energy sources developing climate friendly products and services accessing new markets driven by climate related solutions and enhancing resilience through mitigation of climate risks and sustainable supply chains. Our transition risk and opportunity assessment is based on a scenario to limit climate change to 1.5°C (RCP2.6) above pre-industrial levels. We assessed the risks and opportunities qualitatively. The approach involved representatives from all business areas and corporate functions. The assessment approach is structured along four steps that are described below. First the most relevant drivers of the scenario are identified. These include both macroeconomic forecasts such as GDP and population development as well as techno economic parameters such as carbon and fossil fuel prices by region electrification rates across sectors or deployment rates of technologies. Secondly hypotheses on the impact pathways are formulated based on the information of the previous step as well as the specific value chain of the business areas. The identified impact pathways are structured into risks and opportunities. Thirdly the risks and opportunities are qualitatively scored by representatives of our business areas and corporate functions. Risks and opportunities can also be disregarded or added based on the implications of the scenario on each business area. Finally the risks and opportunities are aggregated based on our ERM risk aggregation methodology. The transition risk assessment is based on three time horizons short term (up to one year) medium term (two to five years to align with both our financial planning and enterprise risk management timeframes) and long term (more than five years). In line with the categories of policy and legal technology market and reputation for risks and resource efficiency energy source products and services markets and resilience for opportunities the corresponding risk and opportunity impact drivers are derived from the underlying scenario narrative by connecting the scenario data with our business area activities. We have assessed the extent to which the company's assets and business activities may be exposed and are sensitive to the identified transition risks and opportunities. This assessment is based on likelihood and potential financial impact of transition events. Both the magnitude and likelihood are rated on a qualitative scale based on our ERM methodology. The duration of the transition risks and opportunities are characterized by their occurrence in the scenario data which is reflected by milestone years such as 2025 or 2030. We chose the “Net Zero Emissions by 2050” scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA) as the basis for the transition scenario analysis as it features net zero CO2 energy sector and industrial process emissions in 2050 while achieving universal energy access in 2030. The selection of scenarios chosen by ABB for the physical and transition risk analysis reflects a wide range of potential future outcomes. On the one hand limiting global warming in line with the Paris Agreement is reflected by the RCP2.6 (1.5°C) scenario whereas a high temperature scenario represented by RCP8.5 (ranging from 3.2°C to 5.4°C) illustrates climate related hazards if climate change cannot be mitigated globally.
| —Climate change related policies | E1-2 POLICIES ABB uses several policies and procedures to manage its impact on climate change. Some of them are overarching documents that apply to more than one topical chapter of this Sustainability Statement. These can be found at the end of the chapter “Sustainability at ABB” and include the ABB Way the Sustainability Policy the ABB Code of Conduct the Supplier Code of Conduct and the HSES Policy. More specific policies are outlined below. ENERGY MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS This policy establishes the minimum requirements to be met for energy management at sites and in operations controlled by ABB. It demands from all ABB units to establish an energy baseline and to classify the significance of their energy footprint. Managers are asked to consider energy in long term planning including the identification and consideration of retrofit requirements. ABB units with significant energy footprints shall introduce a basic energy management system and an action plan. This policy is complemented by an Energy Management Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) which includes concrete examples. The Energy Management Requirements cover 12 of the 24 climate related IROs including all impacts in own operations and the downstream value chain one of the three risks and three of the 11 opportunities (i.e. those relating to own operations). This internal policy applies to all employees and covers all sites and operations controlled by ABB. The most senior level that is accountable for the implementation of the policy is the division presidents. There are no specific third party standards or initiatives referenced in this policy. Relevant internal and external stakeholders are expected to benefit indirectly from the implementation of this policy. This is an internal document that is accessible via the internal network to all employees. NET ZERO PROCEDURE In 2023 ABB introduced an overarching target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. To support the achievement of this target ABB has made several commitments which can be broken down by near term (2030) and long term (2050) horizons. The Net Zero Procedure applies to all employees and units of ABB worldwide joint ventures consortia working partnerships and third party service providers under ABB management control. The most senior level that is accountable for the implementation of the policy is the division presidents. There are no specific third party standards or initiatives referenced in this policy. Relevant internal and external stakeholders are expected to benefit indirectly from the implementation of this policy. This is an internal document that is accessible via the internal network to all employees. RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY PROCEDURE Our Net Zero Procedure (above) specifies the commitments to reach our net zero target including converting 100 percent of our electricity consumption to renewable sources by 2050. This will be achieved through purchase and self generation of renewable electricity. All country wide or site level electricity contracts shall include 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030. The Renewable Electricity Procedure defines what type of contracts sources and market boundaries are acceptable. It largely follows the guidance set by the RE100 initiative. The Renewable Electricity Procedure applies to all employees and units of ABB worldwide joint ventures and consortia under ABB management control. The most senior level that is accountable for the implementation of the policy is the division presidents. The Renewable Electricity Procedure is modelled on the requirements of the RE100 initiative. Relevant internal and external stakeholders are expected to benefit indirectly from the implementation of this policy. This is an internal document that is accessible via the internal network to all employees. FLEET ELECTRIFICATION PROCEDURE As part of our transition towards our net zero target we have committed to electrify our fleet of vehicles in line with the requirements of the EV100 initiative of the Climate Group. The Fleet Electrification Procedure applies to all employees and units of ABB worldwide. The most senior level that is accountable for the implementation of the policy is the division presidents. The Fleet Electrification Procedure is modelled on the requirements of the EV100 initiative. Relevant internal and external stakeholders are expected to benefit indirectly from the implementation of this policy. This is an internal document that is accessible via the internal network to all employees. Adaptation Procedure in progress Based on insights gained from the climate risk assessment adaptation measures will be assessed and designed jointly with the local facility and site managers. Currently ABB does not yet have a global adaptation procedure in place. Developing this procedure is a priority for the coming year.

methodology as outlined by the SBTi and have been validated by the initiative.

SOCIAL PROTECTION IN THE VALUE CHAIN

—Involvement of value chain workers The employees of our suppliers and service providers contribute their share to ABB's sustainability value proposition and benefit from protection against risks associated with their work for us.
The ESRS wording “Workers in the value chain” as an element of sustainability reporting refers to the employees of our value chain partners and how we involve them in our sustainability management.
The objective is to ensure that they contribute to ABB's sustainability targets and to protect them from any potentially negative impacts of the work they do as part of the ABB value chain.

# DEFINITIONS
## — Greenhouse gas emissions

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions refer to all emissions that have a warming effect on the earth's surface by trapping heat in the atmosphere.
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol which sets global standards to measure and manage GHG emissions covers seven GHGs carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as gases used in industry including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) per fluorocarbons (PCFs) sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
CO2 CH4 and N2O are released during the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal oil or natural gas.
At ABB we use the metric ton of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) to calculate our GHG emissions and to measure progress toward our emissions reduction targets.

# UNITS OF MEASURE

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are presented throughout the statement in metric kilotons (kt) carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e) or metric megatons (mt) where 1 metric kiloton CO₂e equals 1000 metric tons CO₂e and 1 metric megaton CO₂e equals 1000 metric kilotons CO₂e.

Energy consumption is presented throughout the statement in gigawatt hours (GWh) where 1 GWh equals 1000 megawatt hours (MWh).

Waste is presented in metric tons (t) and metric kilotons (kt).

|  | Materials used are presented in metric kilotons (kt). |

| —Other reporting principles | BP 2 DISCLOSURES IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES TIME HORIZONS In this statement we comply with the medium or long term time horizons defined by ESRS 1 section 6.4 of short medium and long term for reporting purposes.
| VALUE CHAIN ESTIMATION |
| We work with primary data as much as possible. Estimations based on indirect sources are used eg to calculate scope 3 GHG emissions and avoided emissions datapoints. For further details of the basis for preparation and the methodology used in determining these metrics please refer to “Greenhouse gas emissions” in the chapter “Protecting the climate”. Currently we have obtained only very limited primary data or direct information from third party suppliers and partners to include in our emissions calculations. However we are committed to improving the collection and quality of primary data or information from third parties and are actively preparing the next steps to achieve this. The shift toward a scope 3 assessment increasingly based on primary data will be a gradual process and will be applied where reasonable resulting in a hybrid approach based on a mix of primary and estimated data. |
| SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND OUTCOME UNCERTAINTY |
| There is a high level of measurement uncertainty in this Sustainability Statement in the areas of scope 3 GHG emissions and in avoided emissions. For further details please refer to the section “Value chain estimation” above and to the section “Greenhouse gas emissions”. |
| CHANGES COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING |
| This is the first Sustainability Statement of ABB with reference to the ESRS. In previous years our main reporting framework was the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Wherever possible comparable information for the previous year is provided. As part of the ESRS implementation in 2024 we conducted a Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) and re-evaluated material topics in alignment with the ESRS. |
| REPORTING ERRORS IN PRIOR PERIODS |
| Certain figures that have been reported in the Sustainability Report 2023 have been reclassified or adjusted in the Sustainability Statement 2024 to conform to the current year's presentation or due to refined calculation methods. |
| USE OF OTHER FRAMEWORKS |
| In addition to the regulatory requirements listed above this Sustainability Statement was also prepared in reference to the GRI Standards the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (also known as ISSB Standards) and in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Information previously included in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section is now covered by the Swiss Ordinance on Climate Disclosures as presented in the relevant ESRS sections. An index table at the end of this Sustainability Statement maps our ESRS disclosures to relevant indicators of GRI and ISSB Standards. This voluntary interoperability table is complemented by additional tables for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. |
| INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE |
| Wherever we incorporate information by reference (to other parts of the | Management Report) this is clearly indicated.
| INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE |
| KPMG AG has been engaged by ABB to provide independent assurance for selected 2024 sustainability information disclosed in the Sustainability Statement including reported progress for 2024 against certain sustainability targets our compliance with the provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations (Art. 964b ss.) and the Swiss Ordinance on Climate Disclosures the process carried out by the management for the DMA and its alignment with ESRS and the EU Taxonomy disclosures alignment with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The relevant content subject to limited assurance has been marked as ‘(assured)’ throughout the statement. KPMG AG's full Assurance Statement including opinion and basis of opinion is available in the “Assurance Opinion” section in this statement. KPMG AG's assurance did not extend to comparative periods within the 2024 Sustainability Statement. |
| —Governance of sustainability at ABB | GOV 1 ROLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY BODIES Sustainability at ABB is governed in the following hierarchy ABB's Board of Directors (the Board) reviews and approves our Sustainability Agenda and related targets. Our Sustainability Agenda reflects the value we create for our stakeholders and considers insights of the DMA which takes into account impacts risks and opportunities (IROs) as identified for ABB. Board committees have specific roles in relation to sustainability The Governance and Nomination Committee (GNC) is responsible for overseeing ABB's Sustainability Agenda. The GNC reviews and proposes to the Board the company's Sustainability Agenda and its targets and monitors target progress and achievements. The Finance Audit and Compliance Committee (FACC) oversees the integrity of ABB's sustainability related reporting including its reporting processes systems of internal controls as well as data processing. The Compensation Committee (CC) ensures that our executive compensation policies are appropriately aligned with the Sustainability Agenda. Ultimate responsibility for the company's Sustainability Agenda its sustainability targets and its annual Sustainability Statement lies with the entire Board of Directors. In 2024 topics related to the Sustainability Agenda were discussed in every board meeting. The ABB Group Executive Committee (the EC) validates the Sustainability Agenda and its implementation. It is responsible for reviewing sustainability targets in line with our performance management approach and our operating model as well as for ensuring that a sustainability culture is embedded in our business decision making. In every EC meeting held in 2024 topics related to the Sustainability Agenda were discussed. The Chief Communications and Sustainability Officer who is a member of the EC holds functional responsibility for sustainability and reports together with the Group Head of Sustainability to the GNC on topics and progress related to the Sustainability Agenda. The Sustainability Council is the highest operational decision making body for sustainability. It drives the development of the Sustainability Agenda based on evolving stakeholder requirements oversees implementation and monitors progress towards targets. In line with our operating model the ABB Way -, all business areas are represented in the Sustainability Council by their strategy heads as well as their sustainability leads. Additional members of the Sustainability Council include representatives of our corporate functions sustainability strategy sustainability reporting as well as legal and integrity. Topic specific Workstreams establish targets and roadmaps across business areas and determine the governance for the respective sustainability topics. Additionally they monitor emerging requirements and share best practices across business areas. The Workstreams include subject matter experts from our business areas and divisions as well as members of the Corporate Sustainability team. They regularly report to the Sustainability Council on their progress and receive support from the Council where needed. In line with the ABB Way and our decentralized operating model our four business areas and their divisions are ultimately accountable for putting action plans in place and ensuring that appropriate resources are available to implement these plans and deliver on our targets.
| The Corporate Sustainability team provides thought leadership and governance | sets targets and drives continuous improvement.
| Finally our Sustainability Reporting team being part of ABB's Finance organization is responsible for the preparation of our annual Sustainability Statement. There is a dedicated procedure for the management of IROs applicable for these bodies in the form of the DMA Procedure adopted in 2024. Entity level controls for this Procedure will be in place in the course of the financial year 2025. |
| BOARD AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE COMPOSITION |
| In proposing individuals for election the Board seeks to align its composition skills and experience with the company's strategic needs. The Board strives for diversity in all aspects including gender nationalities ethnicity and age. In addition the tenure of the members of the Board should be well balanced. In 2024 the Board was composed of 70 percent male directors while 30 percent of the positions were held by female directors. Furthermore 60 percent of the Board members are in the age range of 50 to 59 years and 40 percent are between 60 and 69 years. All 10 members of our Board are independent and non executive directors. We did not have employee representatives on our Board as per Swiss corporate law the Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders only and representation of employees is not foreseen. Further the composition of the Board in context of experience was as follows |

# TRANSITION RISKS

In the qualitative transition risk assessment using a 1.5°C scenario policy and legal risks as well as market risks arising from GHG emission pricing schemes could have an impact on our revenue and margin.
Specific identified risks relate to

- • Commodity/raw material prices: As carbon pricing regulations become stricter, the costs of carbon-intensive inputs rise, leading to increased expenses in sourcing and manufacturing, which could affect our profitability.

- • Carbon footprint of the product portfolio: With a growing emphasis on carbon reduction, the demand for low-carbon products increases and we need to adapt our product offerings to align with this trend, ensuring a reduced carbon footprint for the product portfolio. Failure to do so could result in decreased customer demand and market share loss.

A further consideration includes reputational risk which for example could arise from business activities with clients in industries that might be prone to stigmatization due to their contribution towards climate change and thereby reflecting poorly on ABB's stakeholder perception.
Furthermore failing to meet communicated GHG reduction targets could erode stakeholder trust and consequently impact long term revenues.

## E2: POLLUTION

ABB's value chain and operations can have a negative effect on the environment through pollution.
To address these challenges we promote sustainable practices such as supplier environmental criteria and circular economy principles leading to the reduction and elimination of pollution.

There are risks associated with pollution.
Stricter regulations like the potential European ban on per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can disrupt sourcing and materials.
Compliance with new standards would demand significant adjustments.
We pursue a proactive approach to sustainability and resource management to adapt to and mitigate these risks.

### AVOIDED EMISSIONS AMBITION

In addition to our SBTi aligned GHG emissions reduction targets we have the ambition to avoid emissions in customer operations.
Avoided emissions are the reduction in GHG emissions that occur because of the use of a product or solution.
We use the category of avoided emissions to describe the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that our customers will avoid by using our products and solutions through their full service lives.
The methodology for calculating avoided emissions is based on the 2023 guidance of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

- • Ambition to avoid 600 mt CO₂e emissions throughout lifetime of products sold from 2022 to 2030.

#### 6. Transport

- 6.16 Infrastructure enabling low- carbon water transport Construction, modernization, operation and maintenance of infrastructure that is required for zero tailpipe CO2e operation of vessels or the port’s own operations, as well as infrastructure dedicated to transshipment Electrification Process Automation

- 7. Construction and real estate

- 7.6 Installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies, on-site Electrification Real Estate

- 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings Buying real estate and exercising ownership of that real estate Real Estate

Environmental objective Transition to a circular economy

# CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES

The opportunities inherent in the transition to a low carbon society can lead to significant market growth.
ABB's eligible products under the EU Taxonomy (which also meet the substantial contribution criteria as a first prerequisite toward EU Taxonomy alignment currently in process) are a proxy for the numerous product and service lines that cater to the needs of our customers.
A major growth driver identified in the qualitative assessment is the global renewable energy market which drives demand for our products.

Regarding cost saving activities we are investing in energy efficiency and emissions reductions throughout our operations.
For example we have committed to electrifying our fleet of more than 10,000 vehicles by 2030 and continuing to deploy energy management systems at our sites.
These substantial annual investments in energy efficiency and emissions reduction projects frequently come with cost savings in the long term.
This includes for example investments in low carbon energy sources upgrading compressed air systems as well as heating ventilation and cooling systems.

# NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION

Our total non renewable production includes on site electricity generation from oil and diesel as well as from combined heat and power.
The total renewable production includes on site solar generation.

|  | Energy production (in GWh) | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Total non renewable energy production | 13 | 16
|  | Total renewable energy production | 39 | 29
|  | Total energy production | 52 | 45
| —Greenhouse gas emissions | E1-6 SCOPE 1 2 3 EMISSIONS In 2024 we achieved a reduction of 78 percent in our scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 2019. This progress was driven primarily by the roll out of renewable |  | 
![table image]({page: 34, x: 220}, {y: 450, {width: 463}, {height: 46})

energy in our sites a reduction in SF6 emissions and the transition towards electric vehicles in our fleet.
As a result we are on track to reach our near term 2030 target of 80 percent emission reduction.

In 2024 scope 3 GHG emissions have decreased by 8 percent compared to the baseline year of 2022 with key drivers being the decline in scope 3 category 11 emissions due to a shift in the sales mix within our product portfolio with a decrease in the share of more energy intensive products compared to previous years.
As our products are essential for the decarbonization of our value chain the sale of our equipment supports the integration of renewables into the grid and will in turn lead to reductions of our own scope 3 emissions.

For the reporting of scope 3 emissions in category 11 we have previously published a “representative scenario” and a “strict scenario” with the representative scenario quantifying the energy consumption of certain products based on measured energy loss and the strict scenario taking a more conservative approach based on the full energy input to certain products.
Going forward we will use the strict scenario as basis for our scope 3 reporting.

## IRO-1: PROCESSES TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MATERIAL IROs

During the 2024 update of the DMA resource use was confirmed as one of our material topics.
For more information on our process to identify material issues for our sustainability management please see the chapter “Sustainability at ABB”.

The 2024 DMA identified 21 IROs of which 11 were classified as impacts two as risks and eight as opportunities.

Of the 11 impacts six are in our own operations three of these being potentially positive explained as our contribution to a circular economy through renewable resources resource efficiency recycling and similar activities.
Repairing maintaining and refurbishing installations at customer sites will also have a positive impact on the transition to a circular economy.
Three other impacts in this area were assessed as actually negative.
These relate to the depletion of non renewable resources through our use of them.
Actual positive impacts can be observed in our upstream and downstream value chains.
By adopting practices such as product repairability durability and other circular economy principles we can reduce our overall resource outflow.
By developing more circular solutions there is a potential for positive impact on the transition to a circular economy.
Furthermore the application of circularity principles at the end of life of products enables us to reuse resources more efficiently and thus reduce the impact on the environment.

Of the two identified risks one concerns the whole business including value chains.
This is a combination of product obsolescence slow time to market and the unavailability of essential resources.
If these factors occur they could lead to production delays and a reduced financial performance.

The eight opportunities in this field relate to our own operations and one or both parts (upstream downstream) of the value chain.
Among the topics are the opportunity to be seen as a thought leader in circularity development capturing customers increasingly aware of circular economy aspects by useful innovations the access to new revenue streams through circular business models lower costs by reducing the need for new raw materials reducing waste and associated disposal costs helping manage component and material shortages or other similar factors.

E5-1 POLICIES

— PROTECTING CONSUMERS
# SBM-3: MATERIAL IROs AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH STRATEGY AND BUSINESS

| Working primarily with industrial customers ABB has only limited direct or indirect | touchpoints with consumers. |
| --- | --- |
| —Management of consumer related risks | When analyzing our material IROs in the course of the 2024 DMA we identified eight IROs in the consumer and end user field. Of these four were impacts and four risks. All four impacts were located in the downstream value chain. Two of them were identified as actually positive. Consumers and end users benefit from our focus on privacy and our aim to provide a transparent and ethical approach to data handling. This commitment enhances customer satisfaction loyalty and brand perception. Also providing access to quality information empowers consumers and end users to make informed decisions leading to better choices and confidence in the product and value chain involved. The other two impacts were assessed as possibly negative. Both are safety related when safety incidents with our products lead to health accidents or when product misuse impacts “vulnerable” users. Strong safety measures for the use phase of our products and clear instructions can mitigate the risk of safety incidents for customers. The four risks primarily arise within the upstream and downstream value chains with one also directly impacting our own operations. For instance in the e-mobility sector when ABB products are connected to low quality non ABB chargers it poses challenges to our reputation and reliability highlighting the importance of maintaining high standards across all touchpoints. Risks related to information security in the value chain include potential external attacks with ransomware when an incident is not discovered or remediated in a timely manner or if cyber attacks result in significant loss claims by customers.
| —Consumer related policies | S4-1 HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY AND DUE DILIGENCE FRAMEWORK The ABB Human Rights Policy endeavors to ensure that all of our stakeholders including consumers and end users are treated with respect and fairness at all
![table image]({page: 77, x: 212}, {y: 174, {width: 450}, {height: 46})

times.
With regard to consumers and end users affected the human rights issues that are covered by this policy include

- • Environmental issues impacting human rights

- • Health and safety

- • Information security and data privacy

The policy and the associated Human Rights Due Diligence Framework are described at the end of the chapter “Sustainability at ABB”.

### S2: WORKERS IN THE VALUE CHAIN

In our value chain there is a potential risk of negative impacts on individuals involved in labor eg through health and safety risks in mining.
Chemicals and heavy machinery usage in upstream processes can also pose health risks to workers.
Our Sustainable Supply Base Management Program audits and supplier quality audits and active membership of the Responsible Minerals Initiative alongside our Business Ethics Helpline and training demonstrate our commitment to the safety and wellbeing of all individuals in our value chain.

EU TAXONOMY: DISCLOSURES FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2024 (assured)

|  | —EU Taxonomy Background and objectives | At ABB we are determined to shape our future in an environmentally sustainable way by developing and investing in sustainable business activities. The European Union (EU) has taken the lead in standardizing sustainability related data and defining criteria for “environmentally sustainable” activities with the help of the EU Taxonomy Regulation aiming to direct capital flows specifically into such activities. The EU Taxonomy categorizes “environmentally sustainable” business activities into six pre-defined environmental objectives1. It distinguishes between |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Climate change mitigation climate change adaptation | 
| “Taxonomy-eligible” and “Taxonomy-aligned” economic activities. An economic activity is considered “eligible” if it is described in the adopted EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. An eligible activity is only considered environmentally sustainable and thus “aligned” if it meets the specified technical screening criteria |
| sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem. |
| •Substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives |
| •“Do no significant harm” (DNSH) to other five environmental objectives • Minimum safeguards primarily related to human rights and social and labor standards |
| Consequently companies are required to publish the following KPIs turnover | capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with | both Taxonomy eligible and -aligned activities.
|  | —ABB's implementation of the EU Taxonomy | EU Taxonomy is a required reporting framework for companies in its scope and the range of disclosures has been expanding annually. For the fourth year of reporting now on the financial year 2024 the disclosure requirements have been further expanded. For the first time EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment must be disclosed for all economic activities under all six environmental objectives. The EU Taxonomy related disclosures are prepared in line with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the related delegated acts. The legal framework for EU Taxonomy reporting currently consists of the following elements the EU Taxonomy Regulation the amended Climate Delegated Act the amended Disclosures Delegated Act the Complementary Climate Delegated Act and the Environmental Delegated Act including their various annexes. In addition the Taxonomy FAQs and Notices published by the European Commission have been taken into consideration in our disclosures where relevant. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a dynamic evolving legislation. Its formulations and terms are sometimes subject to uncertainty in interpretation and require further clarification. Therefore the following disclosures rely on our current understanding and interpretation of the Regulation the approach applied for this year's reporting is updated in comparison to last year and may not apply in the same way in the future. ABB has been preparing its EU Taxonomy disclosures since the financial year 2021. In 2024 we conducted a comprehensive review of our eligibility mapping to ensure accuracy consistency and focus on performing alignment assessments for activities introduced in 2023 which are directly pertinent to our business portfolio. Additionally it was essential to duly consider the impact of changes to pollution related DNSH criteria applicable for financial year 2024. These pollution related DNSH criteria had the most significant influence on the decline in our alignment figures in 2024. Following the ABB Way and our decentralized operating model we adopted a decentralized approach involving the expertise of our product managers real estate managers sustainability managers financial controllers R&D controllers and environmental managers across all levels of our organization. Our Sustainability Council and the Finance Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors oversee our compliance with EU Taxonomy reporting obligations and are informed of progress potential risks and obstacles.
| ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT |
| Our eligible CapEx was identified centrally at the division level or at the country | level. For OpEx special attention was given to R&D expenses which were analyzed | To determine the eligibility of our revenues,1 we examined our global product offering in relation to the economic activities outlined by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Our revenues were mapped following the ABB product tree by business area division product group product line and industry usage. Most of our eligible products and services fall under the category of “enabling activities” which refers to economic activities that “directly enable other activities to make a substantial contribution” to one of the environmental objectives2. Business activities products and solutions that do not fit into the descriptions of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts are classified as “non-eligible” and are therefore not included in the scope of the EU Taxonomy reporting. We guided our analysis by the descriptions of the activities the relevant Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE) codes and if necessary the substantial contribution criteria. All ABB divisions assessed their offerings at the appropriate level of granularity to be able to determine eligibility. at the division or project level.
| In 2024 we once again reviewed and partially reassessed our eligibility mapping to ensure that all changes in our portfolio are reflected. Overall most of our activities in Electrification Motion Process Automation and Robotics & Discrete Automation business areas together with our Real Estate activities are eligible under the EU Taxonomy of “Climate Change Mitigation” (CCM). In addition some of our activities are eligible under the objective of “Transition to a Circular Economy” (CE). The CCM Activity 3.20 “Manufacture installation and servicing of high medium and low voltage electrical equipment for electrical transmission and distribution” and the CE Activity 1.2 “Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment” are the most relevant for ABB. The table below presents the allocation of our activities to the most relevant economic activities listed in the EU Taxonomy. Changes may be made to this list in the future as additional activities relevant for ABB could be further released by the European Commission. |

### ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAM

At ABB we have zero tolerance for unethical business practices.
Any abuse of power or trust for private gain is a breach of our ethical standards and Code of Conduct and has no place at ABB.
We know that having an adaptive anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) program which allows us to anticipate and meet risks head on is critical for our organizational success.
During 2024 we continued to enhance our ABAC program and to drive the ABAC framework implementation to all business areas.
The ABAC framework is a conceptual overview of existing key ABAC policies procedures and controls that have been designed and implemented across our operations to prevent detect and respond to key ABAC risks that we face as a global organization.

To inform how we continuously develop our ABAC program we continued to perform targeted monitoring and testing activities throughout the year.
In 2024 this included the connection of new data sources to our continuous monitoring platform and the analysis of new business area division and market level insights.
We also carried out a division level ABAC risk assessment regarding the extent of implementation of enhanced policies procedures and controls and developing and monitoring data driven dashboards fed by primary enterprise tools used for day to day business.
Through this we continue to identify key ABAC risks in our operations which we are addressing through various initiatives including targeted face to face and online training of our most at risk employees.

Our global framework for managing third party integrity risk which was launched in 2022 is a key pillar of our ABAC program.
In 2024 the framework was extended to incorporate the identification and enhanced management and mitigation of third party integrity risks within our legacy third party relationships for both our suppliers and sales channels.
In 2025 the focus will be on extending this global framework to our new third party population.

Building on the extensive enhancement of our third party management program in the previous year (2023) we further reinforced our management of third party risks through the expansion of the program to focus on our legacy third party relationships on both the supplier and sales channel side.
On the supplier side our updated Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and the SCoC Implementation Guide provide for an increased focus on business conduct on the part of all our suppliers.
The program has strengthened our risk based approach to selecting third parties and enabled more effective oversight and monitoring of their activities and overall performance across our total population of third parties.


<!-- PAGE: 91 -->
Among the actions we took in 2024 to mitigate specific negative impacts involving our ABAC risks we activated and worked under our first follow up work plan for year two of the three year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA).
The workplan was developed to meet the requirements of a DPA that ABB entered into as part of a settlement with the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced on December 2 2022.
In 2025 we will be activating and working under our workplan for the final year of the three year DPA.
The workplan is characterized by appropriate governance a clear project management structure change management tools as well as resourcing.
It places ownership and accountability for its activities with our business areas and divisions in keeping with the ABB Way operating model.

# 4. POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL

The generic DNSH criteria related to pollution prevention (Appendix C) require that the economic activity does not lead to the production placing on the market or use of chemical substances listed in a variety of EU chemical regulations and directives including the EU Directive 2011/65 on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) and the EU Regulation 1907/2006 concerning the Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
Generally this analysis would need to be conducted at product level.

ABB has robust company wide processes and material compliance systems in place to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements especially RoHS and REACH.
However the Appendix C requirements pose several challenges particularly due to differences with applicable sectoral legislation.
Furthermore an additional requirement has been introduced to Appendix C applicable for financial year 2024 to address “other substances” which is subject to interpretation.
Given our vast product portfolio it is challenging to assess all potentially relevant substances for “suitable alternatives” within the given short timeframe.
We have initiated an evaluation of our products against the Appendix C requirements however we are presently unable to reliably assert fulfillment of these requirements for the relevant products.
Due to our business profile most of our eligible activities necessitate adherence to Appendix C. This effectively precludes most of our revenue from alignment in 2024.

## E5: CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND RESOURCE USE

ABB's business practices have environmental implications through resource use and waste generation.
The material consumption for manufacturing may deplete global resources and increase waste.
However our commitment to a circular economy for instance through recyclable product design and energy efficiency aims to mitigate these impacts.

We can face risks like product obsolescence slow market entry and resource scarcity but we can also pursue opportunities through setting leading practices in circularity.
Innovations like robotics as a service and circuit board take back systems open new business avenues.
Partnerships and startup investments improve market presence and cut raw material costs.
Developing innovative energy efficient and recyclable products is a major ambition for us enhancing revenue and supply chain resilience.

KEEPING POLLUTION IN CHECK

—Double Materiality Assessment for pollution IRO 1 PROCESSES TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MATERIAL POLLUTION RELATED IROs The 2024 DMA identified five IROs in relation to environmental pollution.
Four of them are actual negative impacts of which three are located in our own operations and one in the downstream value chain.
The fifth IRO is a risk prevalent in both our own operations and in the upstream value chain.
This is the potential per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) ban in Europe this would create the need to source alternative materials to be used for ABB products.

The four negative impacts are that (a) products sold can contribute to air pollution when they are used by customers (b) fossil fuel use in own operations can cause air pollution (c) improperly disposed waste or leakages can pollute soil at production sites and (d) waste from the zinc coating process can be harmful to the environment.

For the 2024 DMA process please see chapter “Sustainability at ABB” at the beginning of this Sustainability Statement.

We will include disclosures of ESRS E2 in the Sustainability Statement 2025.
